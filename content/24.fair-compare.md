## Assessing FDO against FAIR {#sec:fair-compare}

| Principle | FDO/DOIP | FDO/LDP | Linked Data examples |
|:---------:|:--------:|:-------:|:--------------------:|
| **F1**: _PID for data/metadata_  | PIDs required (FDOF1). Handle, DOI. |  FDOF-IR (Identifier Record). PID can be any URI?  |  "Cool" URIs [@{https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI},{}], PID using PURL services.  | 
| **F2**: _data has metadata_ | FDO has key-value metadata. Unclear how to link to additional metadata.  |  FDOF-IR links to multiple metadata records |  RDF-based metadata by content negotiation or FAIR Signposting. Embedded in landing page (RDFa).  |  
| **F3**: _metadata include PID_ | `id` and `type` are required metadata elements PIDs, also implicit as requests must use PID | PID only required in FDOF-IR record. | PID inclusion typical, but often inconsistent (e.g. `www.example.com` vs `example.com`) or missing (use of `<>` as _this_ subject) | 
| **F4**: _searchable registration_ | No, registries not required (except Data Type Registries). Handle registry only searchable by PID. | Not specified | Not specified, several registries/catalogues for vocabularies/types (e.g. [@{https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies}, {https://lod-cloud.net/}]). Indexing by search engines if exposing HTML w/schema.org.  |
| **A1**: _retrieve by standard protocol_ | Retrievable from PID (FDOF3). Informal DOIP standard maintaned by DONA Foundation | HTTP standards maintained by IETF, FDO components resolved by informal proposals (custom vocabulary, extra HTTP methods) or HTTP content negotiation) | Formal HTTP standards maintained by IETF, HTTP content negotiation, FAIR Signposting |
| **A1.1**: _protocol open/free/universal_ | Required by G1. Partially realized, although Handle system is open protocol [@{10.17487/RFC3652}] it was covered by software patent [US6135646A](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6135646A/en) ([expired](https://circleid.com/posts/20161025_selling_dona_snake_oil_at_the_itu#11461) in 2013), and only implementation of `Handle.net` software currently only available by [public license](http://www.handle.net/HNRj/HNR-9-License.pdf)] (not OSI Open Source). [CORDRA](https://www.cordra.org/) free to use under BSD-like license, although not recognized by OSI as Open Source. |  DNS, HTTP, TLS, RDF standards are open, free and universal, multiple open source clients/servers exist. | 
| **A1.2**: _protocol can do auth&auth_ |  TLS certificates, `authentication` field (details unspecified) |  HTTP authentication, TLS certificates | 
| **A2**: _metadata even if data gone_ | FDO thumbstone required (FDOF12) | Unspecified, however FDOF-IR links to separate metadata records | `410 Gone` status infrequently used, without metadata. Possible [with signposting](https://w3id.org/a2a-fair-metrics/25-http-citeas-author-410-gone/) | 
| **I1**: _formal knowledge representation_ | Required by FDOF8 | Unspecified | Always implied by use of RDF syntaxes.  |
| **I2**: _use FAIR vocabularies_ | Informally required by G3, formally by FDOF10 (but not in FDOR10) | Unspecified, implied by use of RDF? |  FAIR practices for LD vocabularies increasingly common, sometimes inconsistent (e.g. PURLs that don't resolve) or incomplete (e.g. unknown license)  | 
| **I3**: _qualified references_ | Implied by attributes to PIDs of other FDO | Unspecified | By definition (Linked Data is relating to pre-existing URIs [@{https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data}]). Link relations |
| **R1**: _relevant attributes_ | Required (FDOF4). Kernel metadata attributes desired, not yet decided. | Unspecified. Multiple metadata records can allow multiple semantic profiles. |  Large number of general and domain-specific vocabularies can make it hard to find relevant attributes. Rough consensus on kernel metadata: schema.org [@{https://schema.org/}], Dublin Core Terms [@{http://purl.org/dc/terms/}], DCAT [@{https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/}], FOAF [@{http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/}] | 
| **R1.1**: _clear data license_ | Unspecified (but will be in PID Kernal metadata?) | Unspecified | Dublin Core Terms `dct:license` frequently recommended, but not required, e.g. [by DCAT 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/#Property:distribution_license) [@{https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/}]
| **R1.2**: _detailed provenance_ |  Unspecified (some CORDRA types add `getProvenance` methods). PID Kernel attributes? | Unspecified  | W3C PROV-O, PAV |
| **R1.3**: _follows community standards_ | Recommended (FDOF4, FDOF10) |  Unspecified |  Common practice, specially in bioinformatics, e.g. BioSchemas [@{https://bioschemas.org/}], BioPortal [@{https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies}] |

## EOSC Interoperability Framework

The EOSC Interoperability Framework [@doi:10.2777/620649] recommends:

| Layer | Recommendation | FDO | Linked Data | 
| ----- | -------------- | --- | ----------- |
| Technical | Open Specification |  |   |
| Technical | Common security&privacy framework |  |  |
| Technical | Easy SLAs for service providers | None | None |
| Technical | Access data in different formats | None formalized, custom operations or relations | Content-negotiation, `rel=alternate` relations |
| Technical | Coarse-grained/fine-grained search tools | None | ?  | 
| Technical | Clear PID policy | FDO requirements [], tends towards Handle system. | Not required, different communities set policies |
| Semantic | Clear definitions for concepts/metadata/schemas | FDO requirements[], not yet formalized | Ontologies, SKOS, ... | 
| Semantic | Semantic artefacts w/ open licenses | All artefacts are PIDs w/ license required by kernel metadata? | Open License is best practice for ontology publishing | 
| Semantic | Documentation for each semantic artefact |  No direct rendering from FDO, no requirement for human-readable description  |  Ontology rendering, content-negotiation  |
| Semantic | Repositories of artefacts | Required, but not formalized  | Bioontologies, etc |
| Semantic | Repositories w/ clear governance | Recommended |  Largely self-governed repositories, if well-established may have clear governance.   | 
| Semantic | Minimal metadata model for federated discovery | Kernel metadata | DCAT, ++ | 
| Semantic | Crosswalks from minimal metadata model |  Can be part of definition?  |  Several crosswalks  |
| Semantic | Extensibility options for diciplinary metadata |  Communities encouraged to establish own types  |  Extensible by design, domain-specific metadata may be at different granularity |
| Semantic | Clear protocols/building blocks for federation/harvesting of artefact catalogues |  Collection types not yet defined  |  SWORD, OAI-PMH  |
