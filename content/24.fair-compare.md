### Assessing FDO against FAIR {#sec:fair-compare}

In addition to having "FAIR" in its name, the FAIR Digital Object guidelines [@bonino_2019] also include _G3: FDOs must offer compliance with the FAIR principles through measurable indicators of FAIRness._ [@PR-RequirementSpec-2.0].

Here we evaluate to what extent the FDO guidelines and its implementation with DOIP and Linked Data Platform [@{https://fairdigitalobjectframework.org/}] comply with the FAIR principles [@doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18]. Here we've used the RDA's FAIR Data Maturity Model [@doi:10.15497/rda00050] as it has decomposed the FAIR principles to a structured list of FAIR indicators [@doi:10.5334/dsj-2020-041], importantly considering _Data_ and _Metadata_ separately. In our interpretation for Table @tbl:fair-data-maturity-model we have for simplicity chosen to interpret "data" in FDOs as the associated bytestream of arbitrary formats, with remainining JSON/RDF structures always considered as metadata. 

|FAIR ID                   | Indicator                                                                 | FDO guidelines   | FDO/DOIP    | FDO/LDP    | Linked Data examples    |

[^free]: The [Handle.net public license](http://www.handle.net/HNRj/HNR-9-License.pdf)] is not OSI-approved [@{https://opensource.org/licenses}] as an open source license -- it includes usage restrictions and requires Service Agreements. It is not a DOIP requirement to host a local Handle instance, e.g. EOSC provides the [B2HANDLE](https://sp.eudat.eu/catalog/resources/fc6b2d30-09cd-4c25-b71a-7bc6de77910c) service for acquiring Handle prefixes.

[^patent]: The `Handle.net` system was previously covered by software patent [US6135646A](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6135646A/en) which [expired](https://circleid.com/posts/20161025_selling_dona_snake_oil_at_the_itu#11461) in 2013.

From this evaluation we observe:

* Linked Data in general is strong on metadata indicators, but LDP approach is weak as it has no metadata guidance
* FDO/DOIP are stronger on identifier indicators 
* Indicators on standard protocols (RDA-A1-04M, RDA-A1-04D, RDA-A1.1-01M, RDA-A1.1-01D) favour LDP's mature standards (HTTP, URI) -- the DOIPv2 specification [@handle:0.DOIP/DOIPV2.0] has currently only a couple of implementations and is expressed informally. The underlying Handle system for PIDs is arguably mature and commonly used by researchers (this article alone references about 80 DOIs), however DOIs are more commonly accessed as HTTP redirects through resolvers like <https://doi.org/> and <http://hdl.handle.net/> rather than the Handle protocol.
* RDA-A1-02M and RDA-A1-02D highlights access by manual intervention, which is common for http/https URIs, but also using above PID resolvers for DOIP implementation [CORDRA](https://www.cordra.org/) (e.g. <https://hdl.handle.net/21.14100/90ec1c7b-6f5e-4e12-9137-0cedd16d1bce>), yet neither LDP, FDO nor DOIP specifications recommends human-readable representations to be provided
* Neither DOIP nor LDP require license to be expressed (RDA-R1.1-01M, RDA-R1.1-02M, RDA-R1.1-03M), yet this is crucial for re-use of FAIR data and metadata to be legal
* Machine-understandable types, provenance and data/metadata standards (RDA-R1.1-03M RDA-R1.3-02M, RDA-R1.3-02M, RDA-R1.3-02D) are important for machine actionability, but are currently unspecified for FDOs.
* Indicators for FAIR data are weak for either approach, as too much reliance is put on metadata. For instance in Linked Data, given a URL of a CSV file, what is its persistant identifier or license information? FAIR Signposting [@{https://signposting.org/FAIR/}] can improve this using HTTP Link relations, which enable an FDO-like overlay for any HTTP resource. In DOIP, responses for bytestreams can include the data identifier, if that is a PID (not enforced by DOIP), its metadata is accessible.
* Resolving FDOs via resolution of Handle PIDs to the corresponding DOIP server is currently undefined by FDO and DOIP specifications. `0.TYPE/DOIPServiceInfo` lookup is only possible once DOIP server is known. 

## EOSC Interoperability Framework

**TODO**: Introduce EOSC IF

The EOSC Interoperability Framework [@doi:10.2777/620649] in section 3.6 recommends:

| Layer    | Recommendation    | FDO    | Linked Data    | 
| ---    | -----------    | -----------    | -----------    |
| Technical    | Open Specification    |  FDO specifications are semi-open, process gradually more transparent  |  Open and transparent standard processes through W3C & IETF |
| Technical    | Common security & privacy framework    |  Unspecified |  TLS for encryption, multiple approaches for single-sign-on (e.g. ORCID, Life Science Login). Privacy largely unspecified. |

| Technical    | Access data in different formats    | None formalised, custom operations or relations    | Content-negotiation, `rel=alternate` relations    |
| Technical    | Coarse-grained/fine-grained search tools    |  Freetext  `0.DOIP/Op.Search` on local DOIP, no federation  |  Coarse-grained e.g. [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), fine-grained (e.g. federated SPARQL) require detailed vocabulary/metadata insight  | 
| Technical    | Clear PID policy    | Strong FDO requirements, tends towards Handle system.    | Not required, different communities set policies    |
| Semantic    | Clear definitions for concepts/metadata/schemas    | Required by FDO requirements, but not yet formalised    | Ontologies, SKOS, OWL    | 
| Semantic    | Semantic artefacts w/ open licenses    | All artefacts are PIDs w/ license required by kernel metadata?    | Open License is best practice for ontology publishing    | 
| Semantic    | Documentation for each semantic artefact    | No direct rendering from FDO, no requirement for human-readable description    | Ontology rendering, content-negotiation    |
| Semantic    | Repositories of artefacts    | Required, but not formalised    | Bioontologies, etc    |
| Semantic    | Repositories w/ clear governance    | Recommended    | Largely self-governed repositories, if well-established may have clear governance.    | 
| Semantic    | Minimal metadata model for federated discovery    | Kernel metadata (currently unspecified)    | DCAT, ++    | 
| Semantic    | Crosswalks from minimal metadata model    |  FDO Typing recommends referencing existing type definitions, but not as separate crosswalks   | Multiple crosswalks for common metadata models, but frequently not in semantic format    |
| Semantic    | Extensibility options for diciplinary metadata    | Communities encouraged to establish own types    | Extensible by design, domain-specific metadata may be at different granularity    |
| Semantic    | Clear protocols/building blocks for federation/harvesting of artefact catalogues    | Collection types not yet defined    | SWORD, OAI-PMH    | 
| Organisational    | Interoperability-focused rules of participation recommendations    | Recommended |  Implied only by some communities, tendency to specialise  |
| Organisational    | Usage recommendations of standardised data formats    | None    |  None -- but common for metadata (e.g. JSON-LD) | 
| Organisational    | Usage recommendations of vocabularies    | Recommended by community   | Common (see [RDMKit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/metadata_management))   | 
| Organisational    | Usage recommendations of metadata    | Recommended by community    | RO-Crate, Bioschemas    | 
| Organisational    | Management of permanent organization names/functions    | Handle owner, but unclear contact. Contact info in DOIP service provider    | ROR. DCAT contacts.    | 
| Legal    | Standardised human and machine-readable licenses    | None    | [SPDX](https://spdx.org/licenses/)    | 
| Legal    | Permissive licenses for metadata (CC0, CC-BY-4.0)    | Undefined    | Both CC0, CC-BY-4.0 common, e.g. in DCAT    | 
| Legal    | Different licenses for different parts    | Each part as separate FDO can have separate license    | DCAT, RO-Crate, Named graphs for splitting metadata   | 
| Legal    | Mark expired/inexistent copyright    | Undefined    | Unclear, semantics assume copyright valid    | 
| Legal    | Mark orphaned data    | Tombstone for deleted data, but no owner of DOIP server means FDO disappears    |  Frequently data and endpoint has no known maintainer, archiving in common repositories becoming common  | 
| Legal    | List recommended licenses    | Undefined    | Best practice recommendations   | 
| Legal    | Track license evolution for dataset    | Undefined    | Versioning with PAV/PROV/DCAT    | 
| Legal    | Policy/guidance for patent/trade secrets violation    | Undefined    | Undefined, legal owner may be specified    | 
| Legal    | GDPR compliance for personal data    | Undefined | Undefined |
| Legal    | Restrict access/use if legally required    | By transport protocol (undefined by FDO/DOIP)    | Diverging approaches, typically landing pages w/ auth&auth or click-thru    |
| Legal    | Harmonised terms-of-use    | Undefined    | Undefined    | 
| Legal    | Alignment between EOSC and national legislation    | Not applicable    | Not applicable    | 

Observations:

* The recommendations from EOSC IF are at a higher level that mainly affect governance and practices by communities
* Technical aspects highlighted by EOSC IF 
* Search/indexing is important FAIR aspect for Findability, but is poorly supported by current FDO and Linked Data. There is a strong role for organizations like EOSC to provide broader registries than more specialised metadata federations like OpenAIRE.
* FDO principles have strong recommendations for community development of organisational aspects.
* Both FDO and LD are weak on legal aspects like licensing, privacy and usage policies -- these are essential for cross-institutional and cross-repository access of FAIR objects
