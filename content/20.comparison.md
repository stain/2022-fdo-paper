## Comparing FDO and existing approaches {#sec:comparing}

To better understand the relationship between the FDO framework and other exisiting approaches, we use the following for analysis:

1. An Interoperability Framework and Distributed Platform for Fast Data Applications [@doi:10.1007/978-3-319-31861-5_1], which proposes quality measurements for comparing how frameworks support interoperability, particularly from a service architectural view
2. The FAIR Digital Object guidelines [@bonino_2019], validated against its implementations for completeness. 
3. A Comparison Framework for Middleware Infrastructures [@doi:10.5381/jot.2004.3.5.a2], which suggest dimensions like openness, performance and transparency, mainly focused on remote computational methods
4. Cross-checks against RDA's FAIR Data Maturity Model [@doi:10.5334/dsj-2020-041] to find how the FAIR principles are achieved in FDO, in particular considering access, sharing and openness
5. EOSC Interoperability Framework [@doi:10.2777/620649] which gives recommendations for technical, semantic, organisational and legal interoperability, particularly from a metadata perspective

The reason for this wide-ranged comparison is to exercise the different dimensions that together form FAIR Digital Objects: Data, Metadata, Service, Access, Operations, Computation. 
We have left out further comparisons on type systems, persistent identifiers and social aspects as principles and practices within these dimensions are still taking form within the FDO community (see section @sec:next-step-fdo).

Some of these frameworks invite a comparison on a conceptual level, while others relate better to implementations and current practices. For these we consider FAIR Digital Objects and the Web conceptually, and for implementations we contrast between the main FDO realisation using the DOIPv2 protocol [@handle:0.DOIP/DOIPV2.0] against Linked Data in general.
