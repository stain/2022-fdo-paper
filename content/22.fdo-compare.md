### Assessing FDO implementations {#sec:doip-fdo-compare}

The FAIR Digital Object guidelines [@bonino_2019] sets out recommendations for FDO implementations.  In Table @tbl:fdo-checks we evaluate the two current implementations, using DOIPv2 [@handle:0.DOIP/DOIPV2.0] and using Linked Data Platform [@ldp1.0], as proposed by [@{https://fairdigitalobjectframework.org/}]. 

| **FDO Guideline**                                    | DOIP 2.0            | FDO suggestions     | Linked Data Platform | LDP suggestion       |
|:------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
| G1: _invest for many decades_                    | Handle system stable for 20 years, DOIP 2.0 since 2017. | Ensure FDO types will not be protocol-bound as DOIP might be updated/replaced | HTTP stable for 30 years, Semantic Web for 20 years. `http://` URIs replaced by `https://`. | Keep flexibility of RDF serialization formats which may change more frequently | 
| G2: _trustworthiness_                            | DOI/Handle trusted by all major academic publishers and data repositories. DOIP relatively unknown, in effect only one implementation. |  Further promote DOIP and justify its benefits. Build tutorials and OSI open source implementations. Standardize DOIP-over-HTTP alternative.  |  JSON-LD used by half of all websites [@{}], however previous bad experiences with Semantic Web may deter adapters  |  Ensure simplicity for end developers, rather than semantic overengineering. Example-driven documentation.  |
| G3: _follows FAIR principles_                    | See table @tbl:fair-fdos |  Ensure all FAIR principles are covered, build complete examples.   |  Touched briefly, see table @tbl:fair-fdos |  Add explicit expression to show each FAIR pcinciple fulfilled.  | 
| G4: _machine actionability_                      | CRUD and extension operations dynamically listed (see table @#tbl:fdo-web-middleware) |  Specify which operations should work for a given type, to reduce need for dynamic lookup. Specify input/output expectations formally (e.g. JSON Schema).  |  HTTP CRUD operations, Open API (see table @#tbl:fdo-web-middleware) |  Document operations so client can make subsequent HTTP calls.  |
| G5: _abstraction principle_                      | Handle PIDs as abstraction base. DOIP operations can use any transport protocol.  | Document transport protocols as FDOs, recommend which transport to use. |  URI as abstraction base. Does not specify PID requirements.  | Give stronger deployment recommendations. |   
| G6: _stable binding between entities_            | Machine-navigation through PIDs and operations specified per type. Unclear when metadata field is a PID or plain text. | Make datatype of fields explicit to support navigation. | Machine-navigation through URIs via properties and types. Unclear when URI should be followed or is just identifier, but always distinct from plain text. |    |
| G7: _encapsulation_                              | Operations discovered at runtime (`0.DOIP/Op.ListOperations`).  |  Allow method discovery by type FDOs in advance (not yet specified). | HTTP methods discovered at runtime (`OPTIONS`), indempotent methods attempted directly. Unsupported methods reported using LDP constraints to human-readable text. |  Declare support methods in advance, e.g. OpenAPI [@{https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0.html}]  | 
| G8: _technology independence_                    | In theory independent, in reality depends on single implementations of Handle system and DOIP  | Encourage open source DOIP testbeds and lighter reference implementations  |  Multiple HTTP implementations, multiple LDP implementations. No FDOF implementations.  |  Develop demonstrator of FDOF usage based on existing LDP server.  |
| G9: _standard compliance_                        | Handle [RFC??], DOIP []. FDO requirements not standardized yet.   | Formalize standard process of FDO requirements [@WD-DOC] |  HTTP, LDP. FDOF not yet standardized |  Formalize FDOF from FDOF-SEM working group | 
| FDOF1: _PID as basis_                            | Extensive use of Handle system.  |  Clarify how local testing handles can be used during development, how "temporary" FDOs should evolve [@PID policy]. Register `0.DOIP/*` and `0.FDO/*` as PIDs.  | 
| FDOF2: _PID record w/ type_                      |  |  Document requirements for PID Record {@..} |
| FDOF3: _PID resolvable to bytestream & metadata_ | Byte stream resolvable (`0.DOIP/Retrieve`). No method/attribute defined for separate metadata, only directly in PID Rcord. Unclear meaning of multiple items and bytestream chunks. | Clarify expectations for multiple items. Recommend chunks to not be used. | URIs resolvable by default. Multiple ways to resolve metadata, unclear preference. |  Add FAIR Signposting and preference order.  | 
| FDOF4: _Additional attributes_                   |  Freetext attribute keys. Attributes should be defined for FDO type (?). |  Require that attribute keys should be PIDs (or have predefined mapping to PIDs). Explicitly allow attributes not already defined in type.  |  All attributes individually identified. Any Linked Data attributes can be used by URI or with mapped prefix.  |  Clarify type expectations of required/recommended/optional attributes.  |
| FDOF5: _Interface: operation by PID_             | Extended operations use PID, but "pid-like" DOIP operations/types are not registered as handles. | Register `0.DOIP/*` and `0.FDO/*` as PIDs. Clarify that operations can be mapped to protocol directly. | CRUD operations used directly in HTTP (e.g. `PUT`). Unclear how to provide PID for additional operations. |  Specify how additional operations should be called over HTTP. | 
| FDOF6: _CRUD operations + extensions_            | `0.DOIP/Op.Create` etc. | | `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE`. |  |
| FDOF7: _FDOF Types related to operations_        |
| FDOF8: _Metadata as FDO, semantic assertions_    | 
| FDOF9: _Different metadata levels_               |
| FDOF10: _Metadata schemas by community_          |
| FDOF11: _FDO collections w/ semantic relations_  |
| FDOF12: _Deleted FDO preserve PID w/ tombstone_  |

{#tbl:fdo-checks}

Note that the draft update to FDO specification [@WD-RequirementSpec-1.0-20220317] (see box @sec:next-step-fdo) clarifies these definitions with equivalent identifiers [^2] and relates them to further FDO requirements such as FDO Data Type Registries. 

[^2]: [@WD-RequirementSpec-1.0-20220317] renames _FDOF*_ to _FDOR*_, FDOF3/FDOF4 are swapped to FDOR4/FDOR3. <!-- Fixed in later update-->
