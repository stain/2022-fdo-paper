  abstract: 'Data science is facing the following major challenges: (1) developing
    scalable cross-disciplinary capabilities, (2) dealing with the increasing data
    volumes and their inherent complexity, (3) building tools that help to build trust,
    (4) creating mechanisms to efficiently operate in the domain of scientific assertions,
    (5) turning data into actionable knowledge units and (6) promoting data interoperability.
    As a way to overcome these challenges, we further develop the proposals by early
    Internet pioneers for Digital Objects as encapsulations of data and metadata made
    accessible by persistent identifiers. In the past decade, this concept was revisited
    by various groups within the Research Data Alliance and put in the context of
    the FAIR Guiding Principles for findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable
    data. The basic components of a FAIR Digital Object (FDO) as a self-contained,

  title: FAIR digital object demonstrators 2021
  container-title: Zenodo
  abstract: This paper gives a summary of implementation activities in the realm of
    FAIR Digital Objects (FDO). It gives an idea which software components are robust
    and used for many years, which components are comparatively new and are being
    tested out in pilot projects and what the challenges are that need to be urgently
    addressed by the FDO community. After basically only one year of advancing the
    FDO specifications by the FDO Forum we can recognise an increasing momentum to
    test and integrate essential FDO components. However, many developments still
    occur as soloistic engagements that offer a scattered picture. It is widely agreed
    that it is now time to combine these different pilots to comprehensive testbeds,
    to identify still existing gaps and to turn some services into components of a
    convincing and stable infrastructure. This step is urgently needed to convince
    even more institutions to invest in FDO technology and therefore to increase FAIRness
    of the evolving global data space.

  abstract: "This document builds on the output of the EOSC Interoperability Framework
    Report produced by the EOSC Executive Board Working Groups FAIR and Architecture,
    past EOSC projects (EOSC Enhance, EOSC-hub, OpenAIRE Advance, etc.) and on work
    carried out during the EOSC Future project preparation. The document highlights
    why an EOSC Interoperability Framework (EOSC IF) is needed and defines a lightweight
    process to build such a framework. It focuses primarily on the definition of the
    Interoperability Framework governance and on aspects related to interoperability
    in the EOSC-Core and EOSC-Exchangeplatforms."

  title: From persistent identifiers to digital objects to make data science more
    efficient
  container-title: Data Intelligence
  page: 6-21
  volume: '1'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Data-intensive science is reality in large scientific organizations such
    as the Max Planck Society, but due to the inefficiency of our data practices when
    it comes to integrating data from different sources, many projects cannot be carried
    out and many researchers are excluded. Since about 80% of the time in data-intensive
    projects is wasted according to surveys we need to conclude that we are not fit
    for the challenges that will come with the billions of smart devices producing
    continuous streams of datamethods do not scale. Therefore experts worldwide are
    looking for strategies and methods that have a potential for the future. The first
    steps have been made since there is now a wide agreement from the Research Data
    Alliance to the FAIR principles that data should be associated with persistent
    identifiers (PID) and metadata (MD). In fact after 20 years of experience we can
    claim that there are trustworthy PID systems already in broad use. It is argued,
    however, that assigning PIDs is just the first ...

  title: 'The big data system, components, tools, and technologies: A survey'
  title-short: The big data system, components, tools, and technologies
  container-title: Knowledge and information systems
  abstract: 'The traditional databases are not capable of handling unstructured data
    and high volumes of real-time datasets. Diverse datasets are unstructured lead
    to big data, and it is laborious to store, manage, process, analyze, visualize,
    and extract the useful insights from these datasets using traditional database
    approaches. However, many technical aspects exist in refining large heterogeneous
    datasets in the trend of big data. This paper aims to present a generalized view
    of complete big data system which includes several stages and key components of
    each stage in processing the big data. In particular, we compare and contrast
    various distributed file systems and MapReduce-supported NoSQL databases concerning
    certain parameters in data management process. Further, we present distinct distributed/cloud-based
    machine learning (ML) tools that play a key role to design, develop and deploy
    data models. The paper investigates case studies on distributed ML tools such
    as Mahout, Spark MLlib, and FlinkML. Further, we classify analytics based on the
    type of data, domain, and application. We distinguish various visualization tools
    pertaining three parameters: functionality, analysis capabilities, and supported
    development environment. Furthermore, we systematically investigate big data tools
    and technologies (Hadoop 3.0, Spark 2.3) including distributed/cloud-based stream
    processing tools in a comparative approach. Moreover, we discuss functionalities
    of several SQL Query tools on Hadoop based on 10 parameters. Finally, We present
    some critical points relevant to research directions and opportunities according
    to the current trend of big data. Investigating infrastructure tools for big data
    with recent developments provides a better understanding that how different tools
    and technologies apply to solve real-life applications.'

  abstract: Large Infrastructures follow certain patterns during their evolution.
    The paper looks into three examples (electrification, Internet, WorldWide Web),
    extracts some reoccuring patterns and finally compares it with th state and potential
    of the data domain. Summarising it states that we seem to be close to a convergence
    step, but that we lack the agreement yet on a fairly simple concept all could
    agree with and that can serve as commodity to build upon.
