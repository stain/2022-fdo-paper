### From the Semantic Web to Linked Data {#sec:ld}

In order to describe _Linked Data_ as it is used today, we'll start with an (opinionated) briefing of the evolution of its foundation, the _Semantic Web_.

#### A brief history of the Semantic Web {#sec:semweb}

The **Semantic Web** was developed as a vision by Tim Berners-Lee [@isbn:978-0-06-251587-2], at a time the Web had been widely established for information exchange, as a global set of hypermedia documents that eare cross-related using universal links in the form of URLs. The foundations of the Web (e.g. URLs, HTTP, SSL/TLS, HTML, CSS, ECMAScript/JavaScript, media types) were standardized by [W3C](https://www.w3.org/standards/), [Ecma](https://www.ecma-international.org/), [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/standards/) and later [WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/). The goal of Semantic Web was to further develop the machine-readable aspects of the Web, in particular adding _meaning_ (or semantics) to not just the link relations, but also to the _resources_ that the URLs identified, and for machines thus being able to meaningfully navigate across such resources, e.g. to answer a particular query.

Through W3C, the Semantic Web was realized with the Resource Description Framework (RDF) [@{http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/}] that used _triples_ of subject-predicate-object statements, with its initial serialization format [@{https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222}] being RDF/XML (XML was at the time seen as a natural data-focused evolution from the document-centric SGML and HTML). 

While triple-based knowledge representations were not new [@doi:10.21954/ou.ro.0000f821], the main innovation of RDF was the use of global identifiers in the form of URIs[^4] as the primary identifier of the _subject_ (what the statement is about), _predicate_ (relation/attribute of the subject) and _object_ (what is pointed to). By using URIs not just for documents[^5], the Semantic Web builds a self-described system of types and properties, the meaning of a relation can be resolved by following its hyperlink to the definition within a _vocabulary_. 

[^4]: URIs [@doi:10.17487/RFC3986] are generalized forms of URLs that include locator-less identifiers 
  such as ISBN book numbers (URNs). The distinction between locator-full and locator-less identifiers have weakened in recent years [@{http://info-uri.info/}], for instance DOI identifiers now are commonly expressed with the prefix `https://doi.org/` rather than as URNs with `info:doi:` given that the URL/URN gap has been bridged by HTTP resolvers and the use of Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkr1097]. RDF 1.1 formats use Unicode to support IRIs [@doi:10.17487/RFC3987], which extends URIs to include international characters and domain names.

[^5]: URIs can also identify _non-information resources_ for any kind of physical object (e.g. people), such identifiers can resolve with `303 See Other` redirections to a corresponding _information resources_ [@doi:10.22028/D291-25086].

The early days of the Semantic Web saw fairly lightweight approaches with the establishment of vocabularies such as FOAF (to describe people and their affiliations) and Dublin Core (for bibliographic data). Vocabularies themselves were formalized using RDFS or simply as human-readable HTML web pages defining each term.  The main approach of this _Web of Data_ was that a URI identified a _resource_ (e.g. an author) had a HTML _representation_ for human readers, along with a RDF representation for machine-readable data of the same resource. By using _content negotiation_ in HTTP, the same identifier could be used in both views, avoiding `index.html` vs `index.rdf` exposure in the URLs. The concept of _namespaces_ gave a way to give a group of RDF resources with the same URI base from a Semantic Web-aware service a common _prefix_, avoiding repeated long URLs.

The mid-2000s saw a large academic interest and growth of the Semantic Web, with the development of more formal representation system for ontologies, such as OWL, allowing complex class hierarchies and logic inference rules following _open world_ paradigm (e.g. a _ex:Parent_ is equivalent to a subclass of _foaf:Person_ which must _ex:hasChild_ at least one _foaf:Person_, then if we know _:Alice a ex:Parent_ we can infer _:Alice ex:hasChild [a foaf:Person]_ even if we don't know who that child is). More human-readable syntaxes of RDF such as Turtle (shown in this paragraph) evolved at this time, and conferences such as ISWC gained traction, with a large interest in knowledge representation and logic systems based on Semantic Web technologies evolving at the same time.

Established Semantic Web services and standards include SPARQL [@{http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/}] (pattern-based triple queries), [named graphs](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-dataset) (triples expanded to _quads_ to indicate statement source or represent conflicting views), triple/quad stores (graph databases such as OpenLink Virtuoso, GraphDB, 4Store), mature RDF libraries (including Redland RDF, Apache Jena, Eclipse RDF4J, RDFLib, RDF.rb, rdflib.js), and numerous graph visualization (many of which struggle with usability for more than 20 nodes). 

The creation of RDF-based knowledge graphs grew particularly in fields like bioinformatics, e.g. for describing genomes and proteins. In theory, the use of RDF by the life sciences would enable interoperability between the many data repositories and support combined views of the many aspects of bio-entities -- however in practice most institutions ended up making their own ontologies and identifiers, for what to the untrained eye would mean roughly the same.  One can argue that the toll of adding the semantic logic system of rich ontologies meant that small, but fundamental, differences in opinion (e.g. should a _gene identifier_ signify which protein a DNA sequence would make, or just the particular DNA sequence letters, or those letters as they appear in a particular position on a human chromosome?) lead to large differences in representational granularity, and thus needed different identifiers.

Facing these challenges, thanks to the use of universal identifiers in the form of URIs, _mappings_ could retrospectively be developed not just between resources, but also across vocabularies. Such mappings can be expressed themselves using lightweight and flexible RDF vocabularies such as SKOS [@{http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer}] (e.g. `dct:title skos:closeMatch schema:name` to indicate near equivalence of two properties). Automated ontology mappings have identified large potential overlaps (e.g. 372 definitions of `Person`) [@{10.1007/978-3-642-21034-1_20}] .

The move towards _open science_ data sharing practices from the late 2000s encouraged knowledge providers to distribute collections of RDF descriptions as downloadable _datasets_ [^7], so that their clients can avoid thousands of HTTP requests for individual resources. This enabled local processing, mapping and data integration across datasets (e.g. Open PHACTS [@doi:10.1016/j.websem.2014.03.003]), rather than relying on the providers' RDF and SPARQL endpoints (which could become overloaded when handling many concurrent, complex queries). 

[^7]: _Datasets_ that distribute RDF graphs should not be confused with [RDF Datasets](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-dataset) used for partioning _named graphs_.

<!-- UNFOUNDED - can't find good citations to evidence this anecdotal claim.

Along with experiments on logic systems in the Semantic Web academia, an unfortunate side-effect appeared. RDF datasets would use URIs which no longer (or never) resolved to a Semantic Web representation of the described resources. Inconsistencies would emerge as the production of RDF largely focused on building graph representations of internal databases in order to use the Semantic Web tooling, rather than as a way to expose knowledge on the Web. Ironically, `http` based URLs then becomes location-less identifiers, mainly signifying a localized node within a graph, rather than a resolvable resource.

With these trends, an emerging problem was that adapters of the Semantic Web primarily utillized it as a set of graph technologies, with little consideration to existing Web resources. This meant that links stayed mainly within a single information system, with little URI reuse even with large term overlaps [@doi:10.3233/SW-160238]. Just like _link rot_ affect regular Web pages and their citations from scholarly communication [@{10.1371/journal.pone.0115253}], for a majority of described RDF resources in the [Linked Open Data](https://lod-cloud.net/) (LOD) Cloud's gathering of more than thousand datasets, unfortunately they don't actually link to (still) downloadable (_dereferenceable_) Linked Data [@doi:10.3233/SW-190380, {handle:20.500.11811/7183}].   Another challenge facing potential adapters is the plethora of choices, not just to navigate, understand and select to reuse the many possible vocabularies and ontologies [@doi:10.3233/SSW200033] <!--https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12599 -->, but also technological choices on RDF serialization (at least [7 formats](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/#section-graph-syntax)), type system (RDFS [@{http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/}], OWL [@{http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/}], OBO [@doi:10.1186/2041-1480-2-S1-S3], SKOS [@{http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer}]), hash vs slash, HTTP status codes and PID redirection strategies [@doi:10.22028/D291-25086].
