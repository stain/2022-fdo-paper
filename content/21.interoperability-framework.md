interoperability framework for Fast Data is ... and here we do blaba

| *Quality* |  FDO w/ DOIP               | Web w/ Linked Data         |
|:----------|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| **Symbiotic**: _to what extent multiple applications can agree to interact/align/collaborate/cooperate_      |  Purpose of FDO is to enable federated machine actionable digital objects for scholarly purposes, in practice this also requires agreement of or compatibility between FDO types. FDO encourages research communities to develop common type registries to be shared across instances. In current DOIP practice, each service have their own types, attributes and operations.  The wider symbiosis is consistent use of PIDs. |  Web is loosely coupled and encourages collaboration and linking by URL. In practice, REST APIs end up being mandated centrally by dominant (often commercial) providers, which clients are required to use as-is with special code per service. Use of Linked Data enables common tooling and semantic mapping across differences.  |
| **Pragmatic**: _using interaction contracts so processes can be choreographed in workflows_      |  FDO types and operations enable detailed choreography (see CWFP). `0.TYPE/DOIPOperation` has lightweight definition of operation, `0.DOIP/Request` or `0.DOIP/Response` may give FDO Type or any other kind of "specifics" (incl. human readable docs). Semantics/purpose of operations not formalized (similar operations can be grouped with `0.DOIP/OperationReference`).   |  "Follow your nose" crawler navigation, which may lead to frequent dead ends. Operational composition, typically within a single API provider, documented by OpenAPI 3 [@{https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0.html}], schema.org Actions [@{https://schema.org/docs/actions.html}), WSDL/SOAP [@{http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl20-primer}], but frequently just as human-readable developer documentation/examples. |
| **Semantic**: _ensuring consistent understanding of messages, interoperability of rules, knowledge and ontologies_       |  FDO semantic enable navigation and typing. Every FDO have a type. Types maintained in FDO Type registries, which may add additional semantics, e.g. the ePIC [PID-InfoType for Model](https://hdl.handle.net/21.11104/c1a0ec5ad347427f25d6). No single type semantic, Type FDOs can link to existing vocabularies & ontologies. JSON-LD used within some FDO objects (e.g. DISSCO Digital Specimen, NIST Material Science schema) [@wittenburg_2022] |  Lightweight HTTP semantics for authenticity/navigation.  Semantic Type not commonly expressed on PID/header level, may be declared within Linked Data metadata. Semantic of type implied by Linked Data formats (e.g. OWL2, RDFS), although choice of type system may not be explicit.   |
| **Syntactic**: _serializing messages for digital exchange, structure representation_      |  DOIP serialize FDOs as JSON, metadata commonly use JSON, typed with JSON Schema. Multiple byte stream attachments of any media type.  | Textual HTTP headers (including any signposting), single byte stream of any media type, e.g. Linked Data formats (JSON-LD, Turtle, RDF/XML) or embedded in document (HTML with RDFa, JSON-LD or Microdata). XML previously main syntax used by APIs, JSON now dominant. |
| **Connective**: _transferring messages to another application, e.g. wrapping in other protocols_     |  DOIP [@handle:0.DOIP/DOIPV2.0] is transport-independent, commonly TLS TCP/IP port 9000), [DOIP over HTTP](https://www.cordra.org/documentation/api/doip-api-for-http-clients.html) | HTTP/1.1 (TCP/IP port 80), HTTP/1.1+TLS (TCP/IP 443), HTTP/2 (as HTTP/1* but binary), HTTP/3 (like HTTP/2+TLS but UDP)  |
| **Environmental**: _how applications are deployed and affected by its environment, portability_  |  Main DOIP implementation is [Cordra](https://www.cordra.org/), which can be single-instance or [distributed](https://www.cordra.org/documentation/configuration/distributed-deployment.html). Cordra [storage backends](https://www.cordra.org/documentation/configuration/storage-backends.html) include file system, S3, MongoDB (itself scalable). Unique DOIP protocol can be hard to add to existing Web application frameworks, although proxy services have been developed (e.g. B2SHARE adapter). |  HTTP services widely deployed in a myriad of ways, ranging from single instance servers, horizontally & vertically scaled application servers, to (for static content) multi-cloud Content-Delivery Networks (CDN).  Current scalable cloud technologies for Web hosting may not support HTTP features previously seen as important for Semantic Web, e.g. content negotiation and semantic HTTP status codes.  |

Based on analysis shown in table, we draw the following conclusions:

Web have already showed us we can compose workflows of hetereogeneous Web Services. However, this is mostly done via developer or human interaction []. Similiarly, FDO does not enable automatic composition because operation semantics are not well defined. There is a question as to whether the plethora of documentation and broad developer usage that is available for Web APIs can be developed for FDO.

A difference between Web and FDO is the stringency of the requirements for both syntax and semantics. Whereas the Web allows many different syntactic formats (e.g. from HTML to XML, PDFs), FDO requires JSON. On the semantic front, FDO requries that every object have a well-defined. This is clearly not the case on the Web.

In terms of connectivity and the deployment of applications, the Web has a plethora of software, services, and protocols that are widely deployed. These have shown interoprability. The standards bodies (e.g. IETF and Web Consoritium) are mainly open and have a diverse representation []. In contrast, FDO has a small number of implementations and corresponding protocols. This is not to say that they cannot be developed in the future, but we note that the functionality provided by FDO implemenations can be easily implemented using Web technologies. It's also a question as to whether a highly constrained protocol revolving around persistent identifiers is in fact necessary. For example, DOIs are already implemented on the web [].
