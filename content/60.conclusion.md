## Conclusion

In this work we have considered FAIR Digital Objects (FDO) as a potential distributed object system and compared FDO with established Web approaches focusing on Linked Data. We have described the background of the Semantic Web and FAIR Digital Objects, and evaluated both using multiple conceptual frameworks.

We find that both FDO and Linked Data approaches can significantly benefit from each-other and should be aligned further. Namely Linked Data proponents need to make their technologies more approachable, agreeing on predictable and consistent implementations of FAIR principles. 

The FDO recommendations show that FAIR thinking in this regard need to move beyond data publishing and into machine actionability across digital objects, and with broader community consensus. As flexibility for extensions is a necessary ingredient alongside rigidity for core concepts, the FDO community likewise need to settle on directly implementable specifications rather than just guidelines, and avoid making similar mistakes as the early Semantic Web adopters. 

By implementing the goals of FAIR Digital Objects with the mature technology stack developed for Linked Data, EOSC research infrastructures and researchers in general can create and use FAIR machine-actionable research outputs for decades to come.
