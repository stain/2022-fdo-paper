The **Linked Data** concept [@doi:10.4018/jswis.2009081901] <!--preprint http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/eprint/271285 --> was kickstarted as a counter-reaction to this development of the Semantic Web, as a set of best practices [@{https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html}] to bring the Web aspect back into focus. Crucially to Linked Data is to _reuse existing URIs_ where they exist, rather than always make new identifiers. This means a loosening of the semantic restrictions previously applied, and an emphasis on building navigatable data resources, rather than elaborate graph representations.

Vocabularies like [schema.org](https://schema.org/) evolved not long after, intended for lightweight semantic markup of existing Web pages, primarily to improve search engines' understanding of types and embedded data. In addition to several such embedded _microformats_ (Open Graph [@{https://ogp.me/}], RDFa [@{http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-primer/}], Microdata [@{https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/microdata.html}]) we find JSON-LD [@{https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/}] as a Web-focused RDF serialization that aims for improved programmatic generation and consumption, including from Web applications. JSON-LD is as of 2022-05-13 used[^8] by 42.7% of the top 10 million websites [@{https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/da-jsonld}].

[^8]: Presumably this large uptake of JSON-LD is mainly for the purpose of Search Engine Optimization (SEO), with typically small amounts of metadata which may not constitute Linked Data as introduced above, however this deployment nevertheless constitute machine-actionable structured data.

Recently there has been a renewed emphasis to improve the _Developer Experience_ [@{https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2018/12/28/designing-a-linked-data-developer-experience/}] for consumption of Linked Data, for instance RDF Shapes (expressed in SHACL [@{https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/}] or ShEx [@{http://shex.io/shex-primer/}]) [doi:10.1007/978-3-030-21348-0_39] can be used to validate RDF Data [doi:10.2200/S00786ED1V01Y201707WBE016] <!-- https://book.validatingrdf.com/ --> before consuming it programmatically, or reshaping data to fit other models. While a varied set of tools for Linked Data consumptions have been identified, most of them still require developers to gain significant knowledge of the underlying technologies, which hampers adaption by non-LD experts [doi:10.3233/SW-180316], <!--http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/system/files/swj1849.pdf --> which then tend to prefer non-semantic two-dimensional formats such as CSV files.  

A valid concern is that the Semantic Web research community has still not fully embraced the Web, and that the "final 20%" engineering effort is frequently overlooked in favour of chasing new trends such as Big Data and AI, rather than making powerful Linked Data technologies available to the wider groups of Web developers [doi:10.3233/SW-190372]. One bridging gap here by the Linked Data movement has been "linked data by stealth" approaches such as structured data entry spreadsheets powered by ontologies [@{doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btr312}], the use of Linked Data as part of REST Web APIs [@10.1145/1967428.1967435] <!-- http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/eprint/272098 -->, and as shown by the big uptake by publishers to annotate the Web using schema.org [@doi:10.1109/MIC.2015.81], showing vocabulary use patterns documented by copy-pastable JSON-LD examples, rather than by formalized ontologies or developer requirements to understand the full Semantic Web stack.
