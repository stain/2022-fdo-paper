abstract = {This document has been developed by the Interoperability Task Force of the {EOSC} Executive Board {FAIR} Working Group, with participation from the Architecture {WG}. Achieving interoperability within {EOSC} is essential in order for the federation of services that will compose {EOSC} to provide added value for service users. In the context of the {FAIR} principles, interoperability is discussed in relation to the fact that \textquotedblleftresearch data usually need to be integrated with other data; in addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing\textquotedblright. Our view on interoperability does not only consider data but also the many other research artefacts that may be used in the context of research activity, such as software code, scientific workflows, laboratory protocols, open hardware designs, etc. It also considers the need to make services and e-infrastructures as interoperable as possible. This document identifies the general principles that should drive the creation of the {EOSC} Interoperability Framework ({EOSC} {IF}), and organises them into the four layers that are commonly considered in other interoperability frameworks (e.g., the European Interoperability Framework - {EIF}): technical, semantic, organisational and legal interoperability. For each of these layers, a catalogue of problems and needs, as well as challenges and high-level recommendations have been proposed, which should be considered in the further development and implementation of the {EOSC} {IF} components. Such requirements and recommendations have been developed after an extensive review of related literature as well as by running interviews with stakeholders from {ERICs} (European Research Infrastructure Consortia), {ESFRI} (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures) projects, service providers and research communities. Some examples of such requirements are: \textquotedblleftevery semantic artefact that is being maintained in {EOSC} must have sufficient associated documentation, with clear examples of usage and conceptual diagrams\textquotedblright, or {\textquotedblleftCoarse}-grained and fine-grained dataset (and other research object) search tools need to be made available\textquotedblright, etc. The document finally contains a proposal for the management of {FAIR} Digital Objects in the context of {EOSC} and a reference architecture for the {EOSC} Interoperability Framework that is inspired by and extends the European Interoperability Reference Architecture ({EIRA}), identifying the main building blocks required.}

abstract = {Final report and action plan from the European Commission expert group on {FAIR} data Publication metadata To take advantage of the digital revolution, to accelerate research, to engage the power of machine analysis at scale while ensuring transparency, reproducibility and societal utility, data and other digital objects created by and used for research need to be {FAIR}. Advancing the global Open Science movement and the development of the European Open Science Cloud is the unambiguous objective for this report. This document is both a report and an action plan for turning {FAIR} into reality. It offers a survey and analysis of what is needed to implement {FAIR} and it provides a set of concrete recommendations and actions for stakeholders in Europe and beyond. It is our intention that it should provide a framework that will greatly assist the creation of the European Open Science Cloud, and will be applicable to other comparable initiatives globally}
