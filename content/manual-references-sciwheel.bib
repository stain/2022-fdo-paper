abstract = {This paper gives a summary of implementation activities in the realm of {FAIR} Digital Objects ({FDO}). It gives an idea which software components are robust and used for many years, which components are comparatively new and are being tested out in pilot projects and what the challenges are that need to be urgently addressed by the {FDO} community. After basically only one year of advancing the {FDO} specifications by the {FDO} Forum we can recognise an increasing momentum to test and integrate essential {FDO} components. However, many developments still occur as soloistic engagements that offer a scattered picture. It is widely agreed that it is now time to combine these different pilots to comprehensive testbeds, to identify still existing gaps and to turn some services into components of a convincing and stable infrastructure. This step is urgently needed to convince even more institutions to invest in {FDO} technology and therefore to increase {FAIRness} of the evolving global data space.}

Since about 80\% of the time in data-intensive projects is wasted according to surveys we need to conclude that we are not fit for the challenges that will come with the billions of smart devices producing continuous streams of data\textemdashour methods do not scale. Therefore experts worldwide are looking for strategies and methods that have a potential for the future. The first steps have been made since there is now a wide agreement from the Research Data Alliance to the {FAIR} principles that data should be associated with persistent identifiers ({PID}) and metadata ({MD}). In fact after 20 years of experience we can claim that there are trustworthy {PID} systems already in broad use. It is argued, however, that assigning {PIDs} is just the first ...}

abstract = {The traditional databases are not capable of handling unstructured data and high volumes of real-time datasets. Diverse datasets are unstructured lead to big data, and it is laborious to store, manage, process, analyze, visualize, and extract the useful insights from these datasets using traditional database approaches. However, many technical aspects exist in refining large heterogeneous datasets in the trend of big data. This paper aims to present a generalized view of complete big data system which includes several stages and key components of each stage in processing the big data. In particular, we compare and contrast various distributed file systems and {MapReduce}-supported {NoSQL} databases concerning certain parameters in data management process. Further, we present distinct distributed/cloud-based machine learning ({ML}) tools that play a key role to design, develop and deploy data models. The paper investigates case studies on distributed {ML} tools such as Mahout, Spark {MLlib}, and {FlinkML}. Further, we classify analytics based on the type of data, domain, and application. We distinguish various visualization tools pertaining three parameters: functionality, analysis capabilities, and supported development environment. Furthermore, we systematically investigate big data tools and technologies (Hadoop 3.0, Spark 2.3) including distributed/cloud-based stream processing tools in a comparative approach. Moreover, we discuss functionalities of several {SQL} Query tools on Hadoop based on 10 parameters. Finally, We present some critical points relevant to research directions and opportunities according to the current trend of big data. Investigating infrastructure tools for big data with recent developments provides a better understanding that how different tools and technologies apply to solve real-life applications.}
