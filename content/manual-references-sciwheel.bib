abstract = {This document has been developed by the Interoperability Task Force of the {EOSC} Executive Board {FAIR} Working Group, with participation from the Architecture {WG}. Achieving interoperability within {EOSC} is essential in order for the federation of services that will compose {EOSC} to provide added value for service users. In the context of the {FAIR} principles, interoperability is discussed in relation to the fact that \textquotedblleftresearch data usually need to be integrated with other data; in addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing\textquotedblright. Our view on interoperability does not only consider data but also the many other research artefacts that may be used in the context of research activity, such as software code, scientific workflows, laboratory protocols, open hardware designs, etc. It also considers the need to make services and e-infrastructures as interoperable as possible. This document identifies the general principles that should drive the creation of the {EOSC} Interoperability Framework ({EOSC} {IF}), and organises them into the four layers that are commonly considered in other interoperability frameworks (e.g., the European Interoperability Framework - {EIF}): technical, semantic, organisational and legal interoperability. For each of these layers, a catalogue of problems and needs, as well as challenges and high-level recommendations have been proposed, which should be considered in the further development and implementation of the {EOSC} {IF} components. Such requirements and recommendations have been developed after an extensive review of related literature as well as by running interviews with stakeholders from {ERICs} (European Research Infrastructure Consortia), {ESFRI} (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures) projects, service providers and research communities. Some examples of such requirements are: \textquotedblleftevery semantic artefact that is being maintained in {EOSC} must have sufficient associated documentation, with clear examples of usage and conceptual diagrams\textquotedblright, or {\textquotedblleftCoarse}-grained and fine-grained dataset (and other research object) search tools need to be made available\textquotedblright, etc. The document finally contains a proposal for the management of {FAIR} Digital Objects in the context of {EOSC} and a reference architecture for the {EOSC} Interoperability Framework that is inspired by and extends the European Interoperability Reference Architecture ({EIRA}), identifying the main building blocks required.}

Advancing the global Open Science movement and the development of the European Open Science Cloud is the unambiguous objective for this report. This document is both a report and an action plan for turning {FAIR} into reality. It offers a survey and analysis of what is needed to implement {FAIR} and it provides a set of concrete recommendations and actions for stakeholders in Europe and beyond. It is our intention that it should provide a framework that will greatly assist the creation of the European Open Science Cloud, and will be applicable to other comparable initiatives globally}

Basic components of such a {DO}-based approach have been specified and are being used by some scientific communities.}

abstract = {This document describes fundamental aspects of an infrastructure that is open in its architecture and which supports a large and extensible class of distributed digital information services. Digital libraries are one example of such services; numerous other examples of such services may be found in emerging electronic commerce applications. Here we define basic entities to be found in such a system, in which information in the form of digital objects is stored, accessed, disseminated and managed. We provide naming conventions for identifying and locating digital objects, describe a service for using object names to locate and disseminate objects, and provide elements of an access protocol. We use the term digital object here in a technical sense, to be defined precisely below. Files, databases and so forth that one may ordinarily think of as objects with a digital existence are not digital objects in the sense used here, at least not until they are made into an appropriate data structure, etc., as we will describe shortly. Only the most basic elements of the infrastructure are described herein. These elements are intended to constitute a minimal set of requirements and services that must be in place to effect the infrastructure of a universal, open, wide-area digital information infrastructure system ("the System"). We anticipate that many other services and elaborations will come into existence as the System is further developed, either building upon or otherwise added to these elements. This paper focuses on the network-based aspects of the infrastructure, namely those for which knowledge of the contents of digital objects is not required. Definition of the content-based aspects of the infrastructure is purposely not addressed in this paper. An important goal in limiting the description of the infrastructure in this way is not to constrain the higher level user and service level choices that, for many reasons, might be inappropriate to fix upon at this point in time. With only the most basic elements of the infrastructure in place, technological evolution would not be overly constrained. Further, the likelihood of achieving widespread interoperability of services at some early point in the future will be preserved. No doubt the resulting capability will have a greater potential for enhancement and evolution through the participation of many others in helping to define it.}
