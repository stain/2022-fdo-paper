abstract = {This document has been developed by the Interoperability Task Force of the {EOSC} Executive Board {FAIR} Working Group, with participation from the Architecture {WG}. Achieving interoperability within {EOSC} is essential in order for the federation of services that will compose {EOSC} to provide added value for service users. In the context of the {FAIR} principles, interoperability is discussed in relation to the fact that \textquotedblleftresearch data usually need to be integrated with other data; in addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing\textquotedblright. Our view on interoperability does not only consider data but also the many other research artefacts that may be used in the context of research activity, such as software code, scientific workflows, laboratory protocols, open hardware designs, etc. It also considers the need to make services and e-infrastructures as interoperable as possible. This document identifies the general principles that should drive the creation of the {EOSC} Interoperability Framework ({EOSC} {IF}), and organises them into the four layers that are commonly considered in other interoperability frameworks (e.g., the European Interoperability Framework - {EIF}): technical, semantic, organisational and legal interoperability. For each of these layers, a catalogue of problems and needs, as well as challenges and high-level recommendations have been proposed, which should be considered in the further development and implementation of the {EOSC} {IF} components. Such requirements and recommendations have been developed after an extensive review of related literature as well as by running interviews with stakeholders from {ERICs} (European Research Infrastructure Consortia), {ESFRI} (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures) projects, service providers and research communities. Some examples of such requirements are: \textquotedblleftevery semantic artefact that is being maintained in {EOSC} must have sufficient associated documentation, with clear examples of usage and conceptual diagrams\textquotedblright, or {\textquotedblleftCoarse}-grained and fine-grained dataset (and other research object) search tools need to be made available\textquotedblright, etc. The document finally contains a proposal for the management of {FAIR} Digital Objects in the context of {EOSC} and a reference architecture for the {EOSC} Interoperability Framework that is inspired by and extends the European Interoperability Reference Architecture ({EIRA}), identifying the main building blocks required.}

abstract = {This document describes fundamental aspects of an infrastructure that is open in its architecture and which supports a large and extensible class of distributed digital information services. Digital libraries are one example of such services; numerous other examples of such services may be found in emerging electronic commerce applications. Here we define basic entities to be found in such a system, in which information in the form of digital objects is stored, accessed, disseminated and managed. We provide naming conventions for identifying and locating digital objects, describe a service for using object names to locate and disseminate objects, and provide elements of an access protocol. We use the term digital object here in a technical sense, to be defined precisely below. Files, databases and so forth that one may ordinarily think of as objects with a digital existence are not digital objects in the sense used here, at least not until they are made into an appropriate data structure, etc., as we will describe shortly. Only the most basic elements of the infrastructure are described herein. These elements are intended to constitute a minimal set of requirements and services that must be in place to effect the infrastructure of a universal, open, wide-area digital information infrastructure system ("the System"). We anticipate that many other services and elaborations will come into existence as the System is further developed, either building upon or otherwise added to these elements. This paper focuses on the network-based aspects of the infrastructure, namely those for which knowledge of the contents of digital objects is not required. Definition of the content-based aspects of the infrastructure is purposely not addressed in this paper. An important goal in limiting the description of the infrastructure in this way is not to constrain the higher level user and service level choices that, for many reasons, might be inappropriate to fix upon at this point in time. With only the most basic elements of the infrastructure in place, technological evolution would not be overly constrained. Further, the likelihood of achieving widespread interoperability of services at some early point in the future will be preserved. No doubt the resulting capability will have a greater potential for enhancement and evolution through the participation of many others in helping to define it.}

abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture hasbeen designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. {TheWeb} has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series ofmodifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspectsof the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for themodern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment. Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best topartition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, howinformation is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, andhow all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work ismotivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, therebyobtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. Anarchitectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints. This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture viaarchitectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architecturaldesign of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles fornetwork-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architecturalproperties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce {theRepresentational} State Transfer ({REST}) architectural style and describe how {REST} hasbeen used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web. {REST} emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces,independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduceinteraction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe thesoftware engineering principles guiding {REST} and the interaction constraints chosen toretain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles.Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying {REST} to the design of the {HypertextTransfer} Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequentdeployment in Web client and server software},

This specification defines a special type of Linked Data Platform Resource: a Container. Containers are very useful in building application models involving collections of resources, often homogeneous ones. For example, universities offer a collection of classes and a collection of faculty members, each faculty member teaches a collection of courses, and so on. This specification discusses how to work with containers. Resources can be added to containers using standard {HTTP} operations like {POST} (see section 5.2.3 {HTTP} {POST}).The intention of this specification is to enable additional rules and layered groupings of rules as additional specifications. The scope is intentionally narrow to provide a set of key rules for reading and writing Linked Data that most, if not all, other specifications will depend upon and implementations will support.This specification provides some approaches to deal with large resources. An extension to this specificationprovides the ability to break large resource representations into multiple paged responses [{LDP}-{PAGING}].For context and background, it could be useful to read Linked Data Platform Use Case and Requirements [{LDP}-{UCR}] and section 6.

However, {REST} has also become an industry buzzword: frequently abused to suit a particular argument, confused with the general notion of using {HTTP}, and denigrated for not being more like a programming methodology or implementation framework. In this paper, we chart the history, evolution, and shortcomings of {REST}, as well as several related architectural styles that it inspired, from the perspective of a chain of doctoral dissertations produced by the University of California's Institute for Software Research at {UC} Irvine. These successive theses share a common theme: extending the insights of {REST} to new domains and, in their own way, exploring the boundary of software engineering as it applies to decentralized software architectures and architectural design. We conclude with discussion of the circumstances, environment, and organizational characteristics that gave rise to this body of work.},

abstract = {With the evolution and widespread adoption of contemporary informationtechnologies, data has taken an increasingly central role in almost all areas of human activity.While on one hand this protagonism of data brings significant benefits for the individuals andorganizations, on the other hand it is accompanied by a number of challenges. In the domain of Big Data, Linked Data and Semantic Web, common examples of these challenges includescale, performance, availability, security, diversity, complexity, semantics, manageability andfindability. In January 2014, a group of stakeholders involved in research data came together to debate how to further enhance infrastructures to support a data ecosystem that promotesdata interoperability and reuse. The main outcome of this meeting was the definition of the socalled {FAIR} Data guiding principles aimed at publishing data in a format that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable by both machines and human users. Since the seminal meeting, the {FAIR} Data initiative has grown with an increasing number of participantorganizations and involved projects. In this chapter we report the progress in the developmentof one of the components of the {FAIR} Data infrastructure, the {FAIR} Data Point ({FDP}). The {FDP} is software that, from one side, allows data owners to expose datasets in compliance withthe {FAIR} principles and, from another side, allows data users to discover information aboutthe available datasets and, ultimately, access the underlying data records.}

abstract = {Data integration is a perennial issue in bioinformatics, with many systems being developed and many technologies offered as a panacea for its resolution. The fact that it is still a problem indicates a persistence of underlying issues. Progress has been made, but we should ask "what lessons have been learnt?", and "what still needs to be done?" Semantic Web and Web 2.0 technologies are the latest to find traction within bioinformatics data integration. Now we can ask whether the Semantic Web, mashups, or their combination, have the potential to help. This paper is based on the opening invited talk by Carole Goble given at the Health Care and Life Sciences Data Integration for the Semantic Web Workshop collocated with {WWW2007}. The paper expands on that talk. We attempt to place some perspective on past efforts, highlight the reasons for success and failure, and indicate some pointers to the future.}

It gives an idea which software components are robust and used for many years, which components are comparatively new and are being tested out in pilot projects and what the challenges are that need to be urgently addressed by the {FDO} community. After basically only one year of advancing the {FDO} specifications by the {FDO} Forum we can recognise an increasing momentum to test and integrate essential {FDO} components. However, many developments still occur as soloistic engagements that offer a scattered picture. It is widely agreed that it is now time to combine these different pilots to comprehensive testbeds, to identify still existing gaps and to turn some services into components of a convincing and stable infrastructure. This step is urgently needed to convince even more institutions to invest in {FDO} technology and therefore to increase {FAIRness} of the evolving global data space.}
