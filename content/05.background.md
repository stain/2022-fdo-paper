## FAIR Digital Object

The concept of _FAIR Digital Object_ [@doi:10.1007/978-3-030-23584-0_1] has been introduced as way to expose research data as active objects that conform to the FAIR principles [@doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18]. This builds on the _Digital Object_ concept [@doi:10.1007/s00799-005-0128-x] first introduced in 1995 [@kahn_1995] as a system of _repositories_ containing _digital objects_ identified by _handles_ and described by _metadata_ which may have references to other handles. This  was the inspiration for the ITU X.1255 framework [@{https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.1255-201309-I}] which introduced an abstract _Digital Entity Interface Protocol_ for managing such objects programmatically, first realized by the Digital Object Interface Protocol (DOIP) [@{https://www.dona.net/doipv1doc}].

In brief, the structure of a FAIR Digital Object (FDO) is to, given a _persistent identifier_ (PID) such as a DOI, resolve to a _PID Record_ that gives the object a _type_ along with mechanism to retrieve its _bit sequence_, _metadata_ and references to further programmatic _operations_. The type of an FDO (itself an FDO) defines further attributes to semantically describe and relate it to other concepts (other FDOs referenced by PIDs). The premise of systematically building an ecosystem of such digital objects is to give researchers a way to organize complex digital entities, associated with identifiers and metadata, and support automated processing [@doi:10.23728/b2share.b605d85809ca45679b110719b6c6cb11].

Recently, FDOs have been recognized by the European Open Science Cloud ([EOSC](https://eosc.eu/)) as a suggested part of its Interoperability Framework [@doi:10.2777/620649], in particular for deploying active and interoperable FAIR resources that are machine actionable. Following the development of the FDO concept within Research Data Alliance ([RDA](https://www.rd-alliance.org/)) groups and EOSC projects like [GO-FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/), which specified the initial guidelines for implementing FDO [@bonino_2019]. The [FAIR Digital Objects Forum](https://fairdo.org/) has since taken over the maturing of FDO through working groups that are creating additional specification documents (see section @sec:next-step-fdo). 

FDO is an evolving concept. A set of FDO Demonstrators [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.5872645] highlight how current adapters are approaching implementations of FDO, mainly from two different angles:

 * Building on the Digital Object concept, through the DOIP protocol [@handle:0.DOIP/DOIPV2.0], which uses JSON objects through a custom text-based protocol[^3] (encrypted over TLS) that allows invocation of operations such as retrieving and creating digital objects. These are mostly realized using the reference implementation [Cordra](https://cordra.org/). FDO types are registered in the local Cordra instance, where they are specified using JSON Schema [@{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-bhutton-json-schema-00}]) and PIDs are assigned using the Handle system. Several type registries have been established.
 * Following a more Linked Data approach, either use JSON-LD and schema.org within the DOIP approach (NIST), or following the FDO principles on the Web (e.g. WorkflowHub use of RO-Crate).
