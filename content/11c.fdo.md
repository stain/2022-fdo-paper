The concept of **FAIR Digital Objects** [@doi:10.1007/978-3-030-23584-0_1] has been introduced as way to expose research data as active objects that conform to the FAIR principles [@doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18]. This builds on the _Digital Object_ (DO) concept [@doi:10.1007/s00799-005-0128-x], first introduced in 1995 [@kahn_1995] as a system of _repositories_ containing _digital objects_ identified by _handles_ and described by _metadata_ which may have references to other handles. DO was the inspiration for the ITU X.1255 framework [@{https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.1255-201309-I}] which introduced an abstract _Digital Entity Interface Protocol_ for managing such objects programmatically, first realised by the Digital Object Interface Protocol (DOIP) v1 [@{https://www.dona.net/doipv1doc}].

In brief, the structure of a FAIR Digital Object (FDO) is to, given a _persistent identifier_ (PID) such as a DOI, resolve to a _PID Record_ that gives the object a _type_ along with a mechanism to retrieve its _bit sequences_, _metadata_ and references to further programmatic _operations_. The type of an FDO (itself an FDO) defines attributes to semantically describe and relate such FDOs to other concepts (typically other FDOs referenced by PIDs). The premise of systematically building an ecosystem of such digital objects is to give researchers a way to organise complex digital entities, associated with identifiers,  metadata, and supporting automated processing [@doi:10.23728/b2share.b605d85809ca45679b110719b6c6cb11].

Recently, FDOs have been recognised by the European Open Science Cloud ([EOSC](https://eosc.eu/)) as a suggested part of its Interoperability Framework [@doi:10.2777/620649], in particular for deploying active and interoperable FAIR resources that are _machine actionable_. Development of the FDO concept continued within Research Data Alliance ([RDA](https://www.rd-alliance.org/)) groups and EOSC projects like [GO-FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/), concluding with a set of guidelines for implementing FDO [@bonino_2019]. The [FAIR Digital Objects Forum](https://fairdo.org/) has since taken over the maturing of FDO through focused working groups which have currently drafted several more detailed specification documents (see section @sec:next-step-fdo). 



#### FDO approaches

FDO is an evolving concept. A set of FDO Demonstrators [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.5872645] highlight how current adapters are approaching implementations of FDO from different angles:

 * Building on the Digital Object concept, using the simplified DOIP v2 specification [@handle:0.DOIP/DOIPV2.0], which detail how to exchange JSON objects through a text-based protocol[^3] (usually TCP/IP over TLS). The main DOIP operations are retrieving, creating and updating digital objects. These are mostly realised using the reference implementation [Cordra](https://cordra.org/). FDO types are registered in the local Cordra instance, where they are specified using JSON Schema [@{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-bhutton-json-schema-00}]gre and PIDs are assigned using the Handle system. Several type registries have been established.
 * Following the traditional Linked Data approach, but using the DOIP protocol, e.g. using JSON-LD and schema.org within DOIP (NIST for material science).
 * Approaching the FDO principles from existing Linked Data practices on the Web (e.g. WorkflowHub use of RO-Crate and schema.org).

From this it becomes apparent that there is a potentially large overlap between the goals and approaches of FAIR Digital Objects and Linked Data, which we'll cover in the section @sec:ld.
