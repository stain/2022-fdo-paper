The draft update specification [@WD-RequirementSpec-1.0-20220317] (see section [sec:next-step-fdo]) clarifies these definitions with equivalent identifiers [^2] and relates them to further FDO requirements such as FDO Data Type Registries. 

[^2]: FDOF* renamed to FDOR*. FDOF3/FDOF4 are swapped to FDOR4/FDOR3 in _WD-RequirementSpec-1.0-20220317_.
