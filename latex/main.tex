\section*{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}}

The FAIR principles \autocite{wilkinsonFAIRGuidingPrinciples2016e} encourage sharing of scientific data with machine-readable metadata and the use of interoperable formats, and are being adapted by a wide range of research infrastructures. They have been widely recognised by the research community and policy makers as a goal to strive for. In particular, the European Open Science Cloud (\href{https://www.eosc.eu/}{EOSC}) has promoted adaptation of FAIR data sharing of data resources across electronic research infrastructures \autocite{monsCloudyIncreasinglyFAIR2017b}. The EOSC Interoperability Framework \autocite{corchoEOSCInteroperabilityFramework2021b} puts particular emphasis on how interoperability can be achieved technically, semantically, organisationally, and legally -- laying out a vision of how data, publication, software and services can work together to form an ecosystem of rich digital objects.

Specifically, the EOSC Interoperability framework highlights the emerging FAIR Digital Object \autocite{schultesFAIRPrinciplesDigital2019a} (FDO) concept as a possible foundation for building a semantically interoperable ecosystem to fully realise the FAIR principles beyond individual repositories and infrastructures. The FDO approach has great potential, as it proposes strong requirements for identifiers, types, access and formalises interactive operations on objects.

In other discourse, Linked Data \autocite{bizerLinkedDataStory2009a} has been seen as an established set of principles based on Semantic Web technologies that can achieve the vision of the FAIR principles \autocite{boninodasilvasantosFAIRDataPoints2016a,hasnainAssessingFAIRData2018a}. Yet regular researchers and developers of emerging platforms for computation and data management are reluctant to adapt such a FAIR Linked Data approach fully \autocite{verborghSemanticWebIdentity2020a}, opting instead for custom in-house models and JSON-derived formats from RESTful Web services \autocite{merono-penuelaConclusionFutureChallenges2021a,neumannAnalysisPublicREST2021a}). While such focus on simplicity gives rapid development and highly specialised services, it raises wider concerns on interoperability \autocite{turcoaneLinkedDataJSONLD2014a,wilkinsonWorkflowsWhenParts2022b}.

One challenge that may, perhaps counter-intuitively, steer developers towards a not-invented-here mentality \autocite{stefiDevelopersMakeUnbiased2015,stefiDevelopReuseTwo2015a} when exposing their data on the Web is the heterogeneity and apparent complexity of Semantic Web approaches themselves \autocite{merono-penuelaWebDataApis2021b}.

These approaches, thus, form two of the major avenues for allowing developers and the wider research community to achieve the goal of FAIR data. Given their importance, in this article, we aim to examine the relationships between FAIR and FAIR Digital Objects, contrasted with Linked Data and the Web in general.

Concretely, the contribution of this paper is a systematic comparison between FDO and Linked Data using 5 different conceptual frameworks that capture different perspectives on interoperability and readiness for implementation.

\hypertarget{sec:background}{%
\section*{Background and related work}\label{sec:background}}

In the following, we discuss the related work with respect to FAIR Digital Objects and Linked Data. For the later, we do so by looking through the lens of its development overtime.

\hypertarget{sec:fdo}{%
\subsection*{FAIR Digital Object}\label{sec:fdo}}

The concept of \textbf{FAIR Digital Objects} \autocite{schultesFAIRPrinciplesDigital2019a} has been introduced as way to expose research data as active objects that conform to the FAIR principles \autocite{wilkinsonFAIRGuidingPrinciples2016e}. This builds on the \emph{Digital Object} (DO) concept \autocite{kahnFrameworkDistributedDigital2006b}, first introduced in 1995 \autocite{kahnFrameworkDistributedDigital1995a} as a system of \emph{repositories} containing \emph{digital objects} identified by \emph{handles} and described by \emph{metadata} which may have references to other handles. DO was the inspiration for the ITU X.1255 framework \autocite{x1255FrameworkDiscovery} which introduced an abstract \emph{Digital Entity Interface Protocol} for managing such objects programmatically, first realised by the Digital Object Interface Protocol (DOIP) v1 \autocite{DigitalObjectInterface}.

In brief, the structure of a FAIR Digital Object (FDO) is to, given a \emph{persistent identifier} (PID) such as a DOI, resolve to a \emph{PID Record} that gives the object a \emph{type} along with a mechanism to retrieve its \emph{bit sequences}, \emph{metadata} and references to further programmatic \emph{operations}. The type of an FDO (itself an FDO) defines attributes to semantically describe and relate such FDOs to other concepts (typically other FDOs referenced by PIDs). The premise of systematically building an ecosystem of such digital objects is to give researchers a way to organise complex digital entities, associated with identifiers, metadata, and supporting automated processing \autocite{wittenburgDigitalObjectsDrivers2019a}.

Recently, FDOs have been recognised by the European Open Science Cloud (\href{https://eosc.eu/}{EOSC}) as a suggested part of its Interoperability Framework \autocite{corchoEOSCInteroperabilityFramework2021b}, in particular for deploying active and interoperable FAIR resources that are \emph{machine actionable}. Development of the FDO concept continued within Research Data Alliance (\href{https://www.rd-alliance.org/}{RDA}) groups and EOSC projects like \href{https://www.go-fair.org/}{GO-FAIR}, concluding with a set of guidelines for implementing FDO \autocite{boninoFAIRDigitalObject}. The \href{https://fairdo.org/}{FAIR Digital Objects Forum} has since taken over the maturing of FDO through focused working groups which have currently drafted several more detailed specification documents (see section \ref{sec:next-step-fdo}).

\hypertarget{fdo-approaches}{%
\subsubsection*{FDO approaches}\label{fdo-approaches}}

FDO is an evolving concept. A set of FDO Demonstrators \autocite{wittenburgFAIRDigitalObject2022b} highlight how current adapters are approaching implementations of FDO from different angles:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Building on the Digital Object concept, using the simplified DOIP v2 specification \autocite{foundationDigitalObjectInterface}, which detail how to exchange JSON objects through a text-based protocol\footnote{For a brief introduction to DOIP 2.0, see \autocite{DOIPExamplesCordraa}} (usually TCP/IP over TLS). The main DOIP operations are retrieving, creating and updating digital objects. These are mostly realised using the reference implementation \href{https://cordra.org/}{Cordra}. FDO types are registered in the local Cordra instance, where they are specified using JSON Schema \autocite{Draftbhuttonjsonschema00} and PIDs are assigned using the Handle system. Several type registries have been established.
\item
  Following the traditional Linked Data approach, but using the DOIP protocol, e.g.~using JSON-LD and schema.org within DOIP (NIST for material science).
\item
  Approaching the FDO principles from existing Linked Data practices on the Web (e.g.~WorkflowHub use of RO-Crate and schema.org).
\end{itemize}

From this it becomes apparent that there is a potentially large overlap between the goals and approaches of FAIR Digital Objects and Linked Data, which we'll cover in the section \ref{sec:ld}.


\hypertarget{sec:next-step-fdo}{%
\subsubsection*{Next steps for FDO}\label{sec:next-step-fdo}}

The FAIR Digital Object Forum \autocite{FAIRDigitalObjects} working groups are preparing more detailed \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O1PTLmVWqjQgvJsIcPgaZJe9BntHZt8_QndEG0eRwUY/edit}{requirement documents} setting out the path for realising FDOs, named \emph{FDO Recommendations}. As of 2023-01-05, these documents are in draft stages in Google Docs for internal review and have not yet formally been made public. As these drafts clarify the future aims and focus of FAIR Digital Objects, we provide their brief summaries below:

\textbf{FAIR Digital Object Overview and Specifications} \autocite{fdo-Overview} is a comprehensive overview of FAIR Digital Object specifications listed below. It serves as a primer that introduces FDO concepts and the remaining documents.

The \textbf{FDO Forum Document Standards} \autocite{fdo-DocProcessStd} documents the recommendation process within the forum, starting at \emph{Working Draft} (WD) status within the closed working group and later within the open forum, then \emph{Proposed Recommendation} (PR) published for public review, finalised as \emph{FDO Forum Recommendation} (REC) following any revisions. In addition, the forum may choose to \emph{endorse} existing third-party notes and specifications.

The \textbf{FDO Requirement Specifications} \autocite{fdo-RequirementSpec} is an update of \autocite{boninoFAIRDigitalObject} as the foundational definition of FDO. This sets the criteria for classifying an digital entity as a FAIR Digital Object, allowing for multiple implementations. The requirements shown in Table \ref{tbl:fdo-checks} are largely equivalent, but in this specification clarified with references to other FDO documents.

The \textbf{Machine actionability} \autocite{fdo-MachineActionDef} sets out to define what is meant by \emph{machine actionability} for FDOs. \emph{Machine readable} is defined as elements of bit-sequences defined by structural specification, \emph{machine interpretable} elements that can be identified and related with semantic artefacts, while \emph{machine actionable} are elements with a type with operations in a symbolic grammar. The document largely describes requirements for resolving an FDO to metadata, and how types should be related to possible operations.

\textbf{Configuration Types} \autocite{fdo-ConfigurationTypes} classifies different granularities for organising FDOs in terms of PIDs, PID Records, Metadata and bit sequences, e.g.~as a single FDO or several daisy-chained FDOs. Different patterns used by current DOIP deployments are considered, as well as FAIR Signposting \autocite{vandesompelFAIRSignpostingProfile2022}

\textbf{PID Profiles \& Attributes} \autocite{fdo-PIDProfileAttributes} specifies that PIDs must be formally associated with a \emph{PID Profile}, a separate FDO that defines attributes required and recommended by FDOs following said profile. This forms the \emph{kernel attributes}, building on recommendations from RDA's \emph{PID Information Types} working group \autocite{weigelRDARecommendationPID2018}. This document makes a clear distinction between a minimal set of attributes needed for PID resolution and FDO navigation, which needs to be part of the \emph{PID Record}, compared with a richer set of more specific attributes as part of the \emph{metadata} for an FDO, possibly represented as a separate FDO.

\textbf{Kernel Attributes \& Metadata} \autocite{fdo-KernelAttributes} elaborates on categories of FDO Mandatory, FDO Optional and Community Attributes, recommending kernel attributes like \texttt{dateCreated}, \texttt{ScientificDomain}, \texttt{PersistencePolicy}, \texttt{digitalObjectMutability}, etc. This document expands on RDA Recommendation on PID Kernel Information \autocite{weigelRDARecommendationPID2018}. It is worth noting that both documents are relatively abstract and do not establish PIDs or namespaces for the kernel attributes.

\textbf{Granularity, Versioning, Mutability} \autocite{fdo-Granularity} considers how granularity decisions for forming FDOs must be agreed by different communities depending on their pragmatic usage requirements. The affect on versioning, mutability and changes to PIDs are considered, based on use cases and existing PID practices.

\textbf{DOIP Endorsement Request} \autocite{fdo-DOIPEndorsement} is an endorsement of the DOIP v2.0 \autocite{foundationDigitalObjectInterface} specification as a potential FDO implementation, as it has been applied by several institutions \autocite{wittenburgFAIRDigitalObject2022b}. The document proposes that DOIP shall be assessed for completeness against FDO -- in this initial draft this is justified as \emph{``we can state that DOIP is compliant with the FDO specification documents in process''} (the documents listed above).

\textbf{Upload of FDO} \autocite{fdo-FDO-Upload} illustrates the operations for uploading an FDO to a repository, what checks it should do (for instance conformance with the PID Profile, if PIDs resolve). ResourceSync \autocite{ResourceSyncFrameworkSpecification} is suggested as one type of service to list FDOs. This document highlights potential practices by repositories and their clients, but adds no particular requirements (e.g.~how should failed upload checks be reported?).

\textbf{Typing FAIR Digital Objects} \autocite{fdo-TypingFDOs} defines what \emph{type} means for FDOs, primarily to enable machine actionability and to define an FDO's purpose. This document lays out requirements for how \emph{FDO Types} should themselves be specified as FDOs, and how an \emph{FDO Type Framework} allows organising and locating types. Operations applicable to an FDO is not predefined for a type, however operations naturally will require certain FDO types to work. How to define such FDO operations is not specified.

\textbf{Implementation of Attributes, Types, Profiles and Registries} \autocite{fdo-ImplAttributesTypesProfiles} details how to establish FDO registries for types and FDO profiles, with their association with PID systems. This document suggest policies and governance structures, together with guidelines for implementations, but without mandating any explicit technology choices. Differences in use of attributes are examplified using FDO PIDs for scientific instruments, and the proto-FDO approach of \href{https://de.dariah.eu/}{DARIAH-DE} \autocite{schwardmannTwoExamplesHow2022}.

It is worth pointing out at that, except for the DOIP endorsement, all of these documents are abstract, in the sense that they permit any technical implementation of FDO, if used according to the recommendations.


\hypertarget{sec:ld}{%
\subsection*{From the Semantic Web to Linked Data}\label{sec:ld}}

In order to describe \emph{Linked Data} as it is used today, we'll start with an (opinionated) description of the evolution of its foundation, the \emph{Semantic Web}.

\hypertarget{sec:semweb}{%
\subsubsection*{A brief history of the Semantic Web}\label{sec:semweb}}

The \textbf{Semantic Web} was developed as a vision by Tim Berners-Lee \cite{Guy7cjVY}, at a time the Web had been widely established for information exchange, as a global set of hypermedia documents that eare cross-related using universal links in the form of URLs. The foundations of the Web (e.g.~URLs, HTTP, SSL/TLS, HTML, CSS, ECMAScript/JavaScript, media types) were standardised by \href{https://www.w3.org/standards/}{W3C}, \href{https://www.ecma-international.org/}{Ecma}, \href{https://www.ietf.org/standards/}{IETF} and later \href{https://whatwg.org/}{WHATWG}. The goal of Semantic Web was to further develop the machine-readable aspects of the Web, in particular adding \emph{meaning} (or semantics) to not just the link relations, but also to the \emph{resources} that the URLs identified, and for machines thus being able to meaningfully navigate across such resources, e.g.~to answer a particular query.

Through W3C, the Semantic Web was realised with the Resource Description Framework (RDF) \cite{16WGmCih8} that used \emph{triples} of subject-predicate-object statements, with its initial serialisation format \cite{16wvFH4nh} being RDF/XML (XML was at the time seen as a natural data-focused evolution from the document-centric SGML and HTML).

While triple-based knowledge representations were not new \cite{NxvhwSmG}, the main innovation of RDF was the use of global identifiers in the form of URIs\footnote{URIs \cite{RRtwPF7Y} are generalised forms of URLs that include locator-less identifiers such as ISBN book numbers (URNs). The distinction between locator-full and locator-less identifiers have weakened in recent years \cite{nW4HY8Nq}, for instance DOI identifiers now are commonly expressed with the prefix \texttt{https://doi.org/} rather than as URNs with \texttt{info:doi:} given that the URL/URN gap has been bridged by HTTP resolvers and the use of Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) \cite{HqZ3r6J3}. RDF 1.1 formats use Unicode to support IRIs \cite{rqjuXkEf}, which extends URIs to include international characters and domain names.} as the primary identifier of the \emph{subject} (what the statement is about), \emph{predicate} (relation/attribute of the subject) and \emph{object} (what is pointed to). By using URIs not just for documents\footnote{URIs can also identify \emph{non-information resources} for any kind of physical object (e.g.~people), such identifiers can resolve with \texttt{303\ See\ Other} redirections to a corresponding \emph{information resources} \cite{rnzJ4khD}.}, the Semantic Web builds a self-described system of types and properties, the meaning of a relation can be resolved by following its hyperlink to the definition within a \emph{vocabulary}.

The early days of the Semantic Web saw fairly lightweight approaches with the establishment of vocabularies such as FOAF (to describe people and their affiliations) and Dublin Core (for bibliographic data). Vocabularies themselves were formalised using RDFS or simply as human-readable HTML web pages defining each term. The main approach of this \emph{Web of Data} was that a URI identified a \emph{resource} (e.g.~an author) had a HTML \emph{representation} for human readers, along with a RDF representation for machine-readable data of the same resource. By using \emph{content negotiation} in HTTP, the same identifier could be used in both views, avoiding \texttt{index.html} vs \texttt{index.rdf} exposure in the URLs. The concept of \emph{namespaces} gave a way to give a group of RDF resources with the same URI base from a Semantic Web-aware service a common \emph{prefix}, avoiding repeated long URLs.

The mid-2000s saw a large academic interest and growth of the Semantic Web, with the development of more formal representation system for ontologies, such as OWL, allowing complex class hierarchies and logic inference rules following \emph{open world} paradigm (e.g.~a \emph{ex:Parent} is equivalent to a subclass of \emph{foaf:Person} which must \emph{ex:hasChild} at least one \emph{foaf:Person}, then if we know \emph{:Alice a ex:Parent} we can infer \emph{:Alice ex:hasChild {[}a foaf:Person{]}} even if we don't know who that child is). More human-readable syntaxes of RDF such as Turtle (shown in this paragraph) evolved at this time, and conferences such as \href{https://iswc2022.semanticweb.org/}{ISWC} \cite{yd2WE9eq} gained traction, with a large interest in knowledge representation and logic systems based on Semantic Web technologies evolving at the same time.

Established Semantic Web services and standards include SPARQL \cite{xww8fb1B} (pattern-based triple queries), \href{https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/\#section-dataset}{named graphs} (triples expanded to \emph{quads} to indicate statement source or represent conflicting views), triple/quad stores (graph databases such as OpenLink Virtuoso, GraphDB, 4Store), mature RDF libraries (including Redland RDF, Apache Jena, Eclipse RDF4J, RDFLib, RDF.rb, rdflib.js), and numerous graph visualisation (many of which struggle with usability for more than 20 nodes).

The creation of RDF-based knowledge graphs grew particularly in fields like bioinformatics, e.g.~for describing genomes and proteins \cite{bMSxa8XW,Qlrlr2TZ}. In theory, the use of RDF by the life sciences would enable interoperability between the many data repositories and support combined views of the many aspects of bio-entities -- however in practice most institutions ended up making their own ontologies and identifiers, for what to the untrained eye would mean roughly the same. One can argue that the toll of adding the semantic logic system of rich ontologies meant that small, but fundamental, differences in opinion (e.g.~should a \emph{gene identifier} signify which protein a DNA sequence would make, or just the particular DNA sequence letters, or those letters as they appear in a particular position on a human chromosome?) lead to large differences in representational granularity, and thus needed different identifiers.

Facing these challenges, thanks to the use of universal identifiers in the form of URIs, \emph{mappings} could retrospectively be developed not just between resources, but also across vocabularies. Such mappings can be expressed themselves using lightweight and flexible RDF vocabularies such as SKOS \cite{15gQDya5B} (e.g.~\texttt{dct:title\ skos:closeMatch\ schema:name} to indicate near equivalence of two properties). Automated ontology mappings have identified large potential overlaps (e.g.~372 definitions of \texttt{Person}) \cite{FDDmgO6s} .

The move towards \emph{open science} data sharing practices from the late 2000s encouraged knowledge providers to distribute collections of RDF descriptions as downloadable \emph{datasets} \footnote{\emph{Datasets} that distribute RDF graphs should not be confused with \href{https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/\#section-dataset}{RDF Datasets} used for partitioning \emph{named graphs}.}, so that their clients can avoid thousands of HTTP requests for individual resources. This enabled local processing, mapping and data integration across datasets (e.g.~Open PHACTS \cite{191ZkYZMt}), rather than relying on the providers' RDF and SPARQL endpoints (which could become overloaded when handling many concurrent, complex queries).

With these trends, an emerging problem was that adopters of the Semantic Web primarily utillised it as a set of graph technologies, with little consideration to existing Web resources. This meant that links stayed mainly within a single information system, with little URI reuse even with large term overlaps \cite{9CdJnsoJ}. Just like \emph{link rot} affect regular Web pages and their citations from scholarly communication \cite{AGHR9oyr}, for a majority of described RDF resources in the \href{https://lod-cloud.net/}{Linked Open Data} (LOD) Cloud's gathering of more than thousand datasets, unfortunately they do not actually link to (still) downloadable (\emph{dereferenceable}) Linked Data \cite{5SuwLNdE}. Another challenge facing potential adopters is the plethora of choices, not just to navigate, understand and select to reuse the many possible vocabularies and ontologies \cite{TUmA4KQT}, but also technological choices on RDF serialisation (at least \href{https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/\#section-graph-syntax}{7 formats}), type system (RDFS \cite{ZwAcGQKY}, OWL \cite{1p4IWJpI}, OBO \cite{1DalZuKct}, SKOS \cite{15gQDya5B}), hash vs slash, HTTP status codes and PID redirection strategies \cite{rnzJ4khD}.

\hypertarget{sec:ld-web}{%
\subsubsection*{Linked Data: Rebuilding the Web of Data}\label{sec:ld-web}}

The \textbf{Linked Data} concept \cite{19s3yyxDn} was kickstarted as a set of best practices \cite{OGXYtGZ8} to bring the Web aspect back into focus. Crucially to Linked Data is the \emph{reuse of existing URIs}, rather than making new identifiers. This means a loosening of the semantic restrictions previously applied, and an emphasis on building navigable data resources, rather than elaborate graph representations.

Vocabularies like \href{https://schema.org/}{schema.org} evolved not long after, intended for lightweight semantic markup of existing Web pages, primarily to improve search engines' understanding of types and embedded data. In addition to several such embedded \emph{microformats} (Open Graph \cite{oN9D5LkD}, RDFa \cite{FKIF6ApB}, Microdata \cite{14Utscfe4}) we find JSON-LD \cite{X5SWPqSU} as a Web-focused RDF serialisation that aims for improved programmatic generation and consumption, including from Web applications. JSON-LD is as of 2022-05-13 used\footnote{Presumably this large uptake of JSON-LD is mainly for the purpose of Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), with typically small amounts of metadata which may not constitute Linked Data as introduced above, however this deployment nevertheless constitute machine-actionable structured data.} by 42.7\% of the top 10 million websites \cite{j3SqQLBR}.

Recently there has been a renewed emphasis to improve the \emph{Developer Experience} \cite{BFMoe8FC} for consumption of Linked Data, for instance RDF Shapes (expressed in SHACL \cite{GDrm9dgX} or ShEx \cite{YUzogaV}) can be used to validate RDF Data \cite{ZeOAPNHa,S5BI6Mwx} before consuming it programmatically, or reshaping data to fit other models. While a varied set of tools for Linked Data consumptions have been identified, most of them still require developers to gain significant knowledge of the underlying technologies, which hampers adaption by non-LD experts \cite{o596f2JM}, which then tend to prefer non-semantic two-dimensional formats such as CSV files.

A valid concern is that the Semantic Web research community has still not fully embraced the Web, and that the ``final 20\%'' engineering effort is frequently overlooked in favour of chasing new trends such as Big Data and AI, rather than making powerful Linked Data technologies available to the wider groups of Web developers \cite{jHwttlTs}. One bridging gap here by the Linked Data movement has been ``linked data by stealth'' approaches such as structured data entry spreadsheets powered by ontologies \cite{MhsCt4P3}, the use of Linked Data as part of REST Web APIs \cite{eS6a6tlz}, and as shown by the big uptake by publishers to annotate the Web using schema.org \cite{117tX9MEG}, with vocabulary use patterns documented by copy-pastable JSON-LD examples, rather than by formalised ontologies or developer requirements to understand the full Semantic Web stack.

\hypertarget{sec:comparing}{%
\section*{Comparing FDO and existing approaches}\label{sec:comparing}}

To better understand the relationship between the FDO framework and other exisiting approaches, we use the following for analysis:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  An Interoperability Framework and Distributed Platform for Fast Data Applications \cite{KlCFFFyL}, which proposes quality measurements for comparing how frameworks support interoperability, particularly from a service architectural view
\item
  The FAIR Digital Object guidelines \cite{RwvirqWg}, validated against its implementations for completeness.
\item
  A Comparison Framework for Middleware Infrastructures \cite{hRzcHhPD}, which suggest dimensions like openness, performance and transparency, mainly focused on remote computational methods
\item
  Cross-checks against RDA's FAIR Data Maturity Model \cite{UzQhqk0M} to find how the FAIR principles are achieved in FDO, in particular considering access, sharing and openness
\item
  EOSC Interoperability Framework \cite{aCye3KpE} which gives recommendations for technical, semantic, organisational and legal interoperability, particularly from a metadata perspective
\end{enumerate}

The reason for this wide-ranged comparison is to exercise the different dimensions that together form FAIR Digital Objects: Data, Metadata, Service, Access, Operations, Computation.
We have left out further comparisons on type systems, persistent identifiers and social aspects as principles and practices within these dimensions are still taking form within the FDO community (see section \ref{sec:next-step-fdo}).

Some of these frameworks invite a comparison on a conceptual level, while others relate better to implementations and current practices. For these we consider FAIR Digital Objects and the Web conceptually, and for implementations we contrast between the main FDO realisation using the DOIPv2 protocol \cite{13TcbsZF6} against Linked Data in general.

\hypertarget{sec:interoperability-compare}{%
\subsection*{Considering FDO/Web as interoperability framework for Fast Data}\label{sec:interoperability-compare}}

The Interoperability Framework for Fast Data Applications \cite{KlCFFFyL} categorises interoperability between applications along 6 strands, covering different architectural levels: from \emph{symbiotic} (agreement to cooperate) and \emph{pragmatic} (ability to choreograph processes), through \emph{semantic} (common understanding) and \emph{syntactic} (common message formats), to low-level \emph{connective} (transport-level) and \emph{environmental} (deployment practices).

We have chosen to investigate using this framework as it covers the higher levels of the OSI Model \cite{8ZRGFa6y} better with regards to automated machine-to-machine interaction (and thus interoperability), which is a crucial aspect of the FAIR principles. In Table \ref{tbl:fdo-web-interoperability-framework} we use the interoperability framework to compare the current FAIR Digital Object approach against the Web and its Linked Data practices.

\include{table1}

Based on the analysis shown in table \ref{tbl:fdo-web-interoperability-framework}, we draw the following conclusions:

The Web has already showed us how one can compose workflows of hetereogeneous Web Services \cite{39K3yHT3}. However, this is mostly done via developer or human interaction \cite{iYh1wFBt}. Similiarly, FDO does not enable automatic composition because operation semantics are not well defined. There is a question as to whether the plethora of documentation and broad developer usage that is available for Web APIs can be developed for FDO.

A difference between Web technologies and FDO is the stringency of the requirements for both syntax and semantics. Whereas the Web allows many different syntactic formats (e.g.~from HTML to XML, PDFs), FDO realised with DOIP requires JSON. On the semantic front, FDO requires that every object have a well-defined type and structured form. This is clearly not the case on the Web.

In terms of connectivity and the deployment of applications, the Web has a plethora of software, services, and protocols that are widely deployed. These have shown interoperability. The Web standards bodies (e.g.~IETF and W3C) follow the OpenStand principles \cite{hxtgCGjY} to embrace openness, transparency, and broad consensus. In contrast, FDO has a small number of implementations and corresponding protocols, although with a growing community, as evidenced at the first FDO conference \cite{jrZe6Esu}. This is not to say that it is not worth developing further Handle+DOIP implementations in the future, but we note that the current FDO functionality can easily be implemented using Web technologies, even as DOIP-over-HTTP \cite{p7nwRj8E}.

It's also a question as to whether a highly constrained protocol revolving around persistent identifiers is in fact necessary. For example, DOIs are mostly resolved on the web \cite{1H9iQhQYq} using HTTP redirects with the common \texttt{https://doi.org/} prefix, hiding their Handle nature as an implementation detail \cite{68fzID2k}.

\hypertarget{mapping-of-metamodel-concepts}{%
\subsubsection*{Mapping of Metamodel concepts}\label{mapping-of-metamodel-concepts}}

The Interoperability Framework for Fast Data also provides a brief \emph{metamodel} which we use in Table \ref{tbl:metamodel-concepts} to map and examplify corresponding concepts in FDO's DOIP realization and the Web using HTTP semantics \cite{8HJqcF1Q}.

\include{table2}

From this mapping we can identify the conceptual similarities between DOIP and HTTP, often with common terminology. Notable are that neither DOIP or HTTP have strong support for transactions (explored further in section \ref{sec:middleware}), as well that HTTP has poor direct support for processes, as the Web is primarily stateless by design.

\hypertarget{sec:doip-fdo-compare}{%
\subsection*{Assessing FDO implementations}\label{sec:doip-fdo-compare}}

The FAIR Digital Object guidelines \cite{RwvirqWg} sets out recommendations for FDO implementations. In Table \ref{tbl:fdo-checks} we evaluate the two current implementations, using DOIPv2 \cite{13TcbsZF6} and using Linked Data Platform \cite{17OHlMRQA}, as proposed by \cite{7szz7dwO}.

\include{table3}

Note that the draft update to FDO specification \cite{yygVPoL0} (see box \ref{sec:next-step-fdo}) clarifies these definitions with equivalent identifiers\footnote{Newer \cite{yygVPoL0} renames \texttt{FDOF*} to \texttt{FDOR*} but follows same ordering.} and relates them to further FDO requirements such as FDO Data Type Registries.

A key observation from this is that simply using DOIP does not achieve many of the FDO guidelines. Rather the guidelines set out how a protocol like DOIPs should be used to achieve FAIR Digital Object goals. The DOIP Endorsement \cite{15yGpJ0wh} sets out that to comply, DOIP must be used according to the set of FDO requirement documents (see box \ref{sec:next-step-fdo}), and notes \emph{Achieving FDO compliance requires more than DOIP and full compliance is thus left to system designers}. Likewise, a Linked Data approach will need to follow the same requirements to comply as an FDO implementation.

From our evaluation, we can observe:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  G1 and G2 call for stability and trustworthiness. While the foundations of both DOIP and Linked Data approaches are now well established -- the FDO requirements and in particular how they can be implemented are still taking shape and subject to change.
\item
  Machine actionability (G4, G6) is a core feature of both FDOs and Linked Data. Conceptually they differ in the which way types and operations are discovered, with FDO seemingly more rigorous. In practice, however, we see that DOIP also relies on dynamic discovery of operations and that operation expectations for types (FDOF7) have not yet been defined.
\item
  FDO proposes that types can have additional operations beyond CRUD (FDOF5, FDOF6), while Linked Data mainly achieves this with RESTful patterns using CRUD on additional resources, e.g.~\texttt{order/152/items}. These are mainly stylistics but affect the architectural view -- FDOs have more of an object-oriented approach.
\item
  FDO puts strong emphasis on the use of PIDs (FDOF1, FDOF2, FDOF3, FDOF5), but in current practice DOIP use local types, local extended operations (FDOF5) and attributes (FDOF4) that are not bound to any global namespace.
\item
  Linked Data have a strong emphasis on semantics (FDOF8), and metadata schemas developed by community agreements (FDOF10). FDO types need to be made reusable across servers.
\item
  While FDO recommends nested metadata FDOs (FDOF8, FDOF9), in practice this is not found (or linked with custom keys), particularly due to lack of namespaces and the favouring of local types rather than type/property re-use. Linked Data frequently have multiple representations, but often not sufficiently linked, perhaps \texttt{prov:specializationOf} \cite{9T4j3N4e}
\item
  FDO collections are not yet defined for DOIP, while Linked Data seemingly have too many alternatives, LDP has specific native support for containers.
\item
  Tombstones for deleted resources are not well supported, nor specified, for either approach, although the continued availability of metadata when data is removed is a requirement for FAIR principles (see RDA-A2-01M in table \ref{sec:fair-compare}).
\item
  DOIP supports multiple chunks of data for an object (FDOF3), while Linked Data can support content-negotiation. In either case it can be unclear to clients what is the meaning or equivalence of any additional chunks.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{sec:middleware}{%
\subsection*{Comparing FDO and Web as middleware infrastructures}\label{sec:middleware}}

In this section we take the perspective that FDO principles are in effect proposing a global infrastructure of machine-actionable digital objects. As such we can consider implementations of FDO as \textbf{middleware infrastructures} for programmatic usage, and can evaluate them based on expectations for client and server developers.

We argue that the Web, with its now ubiquitous use of REST API \cite{174AwcFUL}, can be compared as a similar global middleware. Note that while early moves for developing Semantic Web Services \cite{WzPECPDP} attempted to merge the Web Service and RDF aspects, we are here considering mainly the current programmatic Web and its mostly light-weight use of \emph{★★★ Linked Data} \cite{11dInoyVF}.

For this purpose, we here utillise the Comparison Framework for Middleware Infrastructures \cite{hRzcHhPD} that formalise multiple dimensions of openness, scalability, transparency, as well as characteristics known from Object-oriented programming such as modularity, encapsulation and inheritance.

\include{table4}


Based on the analysis in Table \ref{tbl:fdo-web-middleware}, we make the following observations:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  With respect to the aspect of \emph{Performance}, it is interesting to note that while the first version of DOIP \cite{16uB3jxpa} supported multiplexed channels similar to HTTP/2 (allowing concurrent transfer of several digital objects). Multiplexing was removed for the much simplified DOIP 2.0 \cite{13TcbsZF6}. Unlike DOIP 1.0, DOIP 2.0 will require a DO response to be sent back completely, as a series of segments (which again can be split the bytes of each binary \emph{element} into sized \emph{chunks}), before transmission of another DO response can start on the transport channel. It is unclear what is the purpose of splitting a binary into chunks on a channel which no longer can be multiplexed and the only property of a chunk is its size\footnote{Although it is possible with \texttt{0.DOIP/Op.Retrieve} to request only particular individual elements of an DO (e.g.~one file), unlike HTTP's \texttt{Range} request, it is not possible to select individual chunks of an element's bytestream.}.
\item
  HTTP has strong support for scalability and caching, but this mostly assumes read-operations from static resources. FDO has no view on immutability or validity of retrieved objects, but this should be taken into consideration to support large-scale usage.
\item
  HTTP optimisations for performance (e.g.~HTTP/2, multiplexing) is largely used for commercial media distribution (e.g.~Netflix), and not commonly used by providers of FAIR data
\item
  Cloud deployment of Web applications give many middleware benefits (Scalability, Distribution, Access transparancy, Location transparancy) -- it is unclear how DOIP as a custom protocol would perform in a cloud setting as most of this infrastructure assumes HTTP as the protocol.
\item
  Programmatically the Web is rather unstructured as middleware, as there are many implementation choices. Usually it is undeclared what to expect for a given URI/service, and programmers follow documented examples for a particular service rather than automated programmatic exploration across providers. This mean one can consider the Web as an ecosystem of smaller middlewares with commonalities.
\item
  Many providers of FAIR Linked Data also provide programmatic REST API endpoints, e.g.~\href{https://www.uniprot.org/help/programmatic_access}{UNIPROT}, \href{https://chembl.gitbook.io/chembl-interface-documentation/web-services}{ChEMBL}, but keeping the FAIR aspects such as retrieving metadata in such a scenario may require combining different services using multiple formats and identifier conventions.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{sec:fair-compare}{%
\subsection*{Assessing FDO against FAIR}\label{sec:fair-compare}}

In addition to having ``FAIR'' in its name, the FAIR Digital Object guidelines \cite{RwvirqWg} also include \emph{G3: FDOs must offer compliance with the FAIR principles through measurable indicators of FAIRness.} \cite{PR-RequirementSpec-2.0}.

Here we evaluate to what extent the FDO guidelines and its implementation with DOIP and Linked Data Platform \cite{7szz7dwO} comply with the FAIR principles \cite{6DjakjNS}. Here we've used the RDA's FAIR Data Maturity Model \cite{1GrKTFaK2} as it has decomposed the FAIR principles to a structured list of FAIR indicators \cite{UzQhqk0M}, importantly considering \emph{Data} and \emph{Metadata} separately. In our interpretation for Table \ref{tbl:fair-data-maturity-model} we have for simplicity chosen to interpret ``data'' in FDOs as the associated bytestream of arbitrary formats, with remainining JSON/RDF structures always considered as metadata.

\include{table5}


From this evaluation we observe:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Linked Data in general is strong on metadata indicators, but LDP approach is weak as it has little metadata guidance
\item
  FDO/DOIP are stronger on identifier indicators
\item
  Indicators on standard protocols (RDA-A1-04M, RDA-A1-04D, RDA-A1.1-01M, RDA-A1.1-01D) favour LDP's mature standards (HTTP, URI) -- the DOIPv2 specification \cite{13TcbsZF6} has currently only a couple of implementations and is expressed informally. The underlying Handle system for PIDs is arguably mature and commonly used by researchers (this article alone references about 80 DOIs), however DOIs are more commonly accessed as HTTP redirects through resolvers like \url{https://doi.org/} and \url{http://hdl.handle.net/} rather than the Handle protocol.
\item
  RDA-A1-02M and RDA-A1-02D highlights access by manual intervention, which is common for http/https URIs, but also using above PID resolvers for DOIP implementation \href{https://www.cordra.org/}{CORDRA} (e.g.~\url{https://hdl.handle.net/21.14100/90ec1c7b-6f5e-4e12-9137-0cedd16d1bce}), yet neither LDP, FDO nor DOIP specifications recommends human-readable representations to be provided
\item
  Neither DOIP nor LDP require license to be expressed (RDA-R1.1-01M, RDA-R1.1-02M, RDA-R1.1-03M), yet this is crucial for re-use and machine actionability of FAIR data and metadata to be legal
\item
  Machine-understandable types, provenance and data/metadata standards (RDA-R1.1-03M RDA-R1.3-02M, RDA-R1.3-02M, RDA-R1.3-02D) are important for machine actionability, but are currently unspecified for FDOs. \cite{126uxr5pI} explores possible machine-readable FDO types, however the type systems themselves have not yet been formalised. Linked Data on the other side have too many semantic and syntactic type systems, making it difficult to write consistent clients.
\item
  Indicators for FAIR data are weak for either approach, as too much reliance is put on metadata. For instance in Linked Data, given a URL of a CSV file, what is its persistant identifier or license information? FAIR Signposting \cite{snykkm7R} can improve findability of metadata using HTTP Link relations, which enable an FDO-like overlay for any HTTP resource. In DOIP, responses for bytestreams can include the data identifier: if that is a PID (not enforced by DOIP), its metadata is accessible.
\item
  Resolving FDOs via Handle PIDs to the corresponding DOIP server is currently undefined by FDO and DOIP specifications. \texttt{0.TYPE/DOIPServiceInfo} lookup is only possible once DOIP server is known.
\end{itemize}

Observations:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The recommendations from EOSC IF are at a higher level that mainly affect governance and practices by communities
\item
  Technical aspects highlighted by EOSC IF
\item
  Search/indexing is important FAIR aspect for Findability, but is poorly supported by current FDO and Linked Data. There is a strong role for organizations like EOSC to provide broader registries than more specialised metadata federations like OpenAIRE.
\item
  FDO principles have strong recommendations for community development of organisational aspects.
\item
  Both FDO and LD are weak on legal aspects like licensing, privacy and usage policies -- these are essential for cross-institutional and cross-repository access of FAIR objects

\hypertarget{what-does-it-mean-for-linked-data}{%
\subsection*{(What does it mean for Linked Data?)}\label{what-does-it-mean-for-linked-data}}

The FAIR Digital Object approach raises many important points for Linked Data practictioners.
At first glance, the explicit requirements of FDOs may seem to be easy to furfill by different parts of the Semantic Web Cake \cite{kYjzRJ0H}.
However, our deeper investigation, based on multiple frameworks, highlights that the openness and variability of how Linked Data is deployed makes it difficult to achieve the FDO goals without significant effort.

While RDF and Linked Data have been suggested as prime candidates for making FAIR data, we argue that when different developers have too many degrees of freedom (such as serialization formats, vocabularies, identifiers, navigation), interoperability is hampered -- this makes it hard for machines to reliably consume multiple FAIR resources across repositories and data providers.

We therefore identify the need for an explicit FDO profile of Linked Data that sets pragmatic constraints and stronger recommendations for consistent and developer-friendly deployment of digital objects.
Such a combination of efforts will utillise both the benefits of mature Semantic Web technologies (e.g.~federated knowledge graph queries and rich validation) and data management practices that follow FDO guidance in order to grow a rigid (yet flexible) ecosystem of machine-actionable scholarly objects.
