abstract = {The Minimum Information Required in the Annotation of Models Registry (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam) provides unique, perennial and location-independent identifiers for data used in the biomedical domain. At its core is a shared catalogue of data collections, for each of which an individual namespace is created, and extensive metadata recorded. This namespace allows the generation of Uniform Resource Identifiers ({URIs}) to uniquely identify any record in a collection. Moreover, various services are provided to facilitate the creation and resolution of the identifiers. Since its launch in 2005, the system has evolved in terms of the structure of the identifiers provided, the software infrastructure, the number of data collections recorded, as well as the scope of the Registry itself. We describe here the new parallel identification scheme and the updated supporting software infrastructure. We also introduce the new Identifiers.org service (http://identifiers.org) that is built upon the information stored in the Registry and which provides directly resolvable identifiers, in the form of Uniform Resource Locators ({URLs}). The flexibility of the identification scheme and resolving system allows its use in many different fields, where unambiguous and perennial identification of data entities are necessary.}

The fact that it is still a problem indicates a persistence of underlying issues. Progress has been made, but we should ask "what lessons have been learnt?", and "what still needs to be done?" Semantic Web and Web 2.0 technologies are the latest to find traction within bioinformatics data integration. Now we can ask whether the Semantic Web, mashups, or their combination, have the potential to help. This paper is based on the opening invited talk by Carole Goble given at the Health Care and Life Sciences Data Integration for the Semantic Web Workshop collocated with {WWW2007}. The paper expands on that talk. We attempt to place some perspective on past efforts, highlight the reasons for success and failure, and indicate some pointers to the future.}

abstract = {The emergence of the web has fundamentally affected most aspects of information communication, including scholarly communication. The immediacy that characterizes publishing information to the web, as well as accessing it, allows for a dramatic increase in the speed of dissemination of scholarly knowledge. But, the transition from a paper-based to a web-based scholarly communication system also poses challenges. In this paper, we focus on reference rot, the combination of link rot and content drift to which references to web resources included in Science, Technology, and Medicine ({STM}) articles are subject. We investigate the extent to which reference rot impacts the ability to revisit the web context that surrounds {STM} articles some time after their publication. We do so on the basis of a vast collection of articles from three corpora that span publication years 1997 to 2012. For over one million references to web resources extracted from over 3.5 million articles, we determine whether the {HTTP} {URI} is still responsive on the live web and whether web archives contain an archived snapshot representative of the state the referenced resource had at the time it was referenced. We observe that the fraction of articles containing references to web resources is growing steadily over time. We find one out of five {STM} articles suffering from reference rot, meaning it is impossible to revisit the web context that surrounds them some time after their publication. When only considering {STM} articles that contain references to web resources, this fraction increases to seven out of ten. We suggest that, in order to safeguard the long-term integrity of the web-based scholarly record, robust solutions to combat the reference rot problem are required. In conclusion, we provide a brief insight into the directions that are explored with this regard in the context of the Hiberlink project.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Ontologies are commonly used in biomedicine to organize concepts to describe domains such as anatomies, environments, experiment, taxonomies etc. {NCBO} {BioPortal} currently hosts about 180 different biomedical ontologies. These ontologies have been mainly expressed in either the Open Biomedical Ontology ({OBO}) format or the Web Ontology Language ({OWL}). {OBO} emerged from the Gene Ontology, and supports most of the biomedical ontology content. In comparison, {OWL} is a Semantic Web language, and is supported by the World Wide Web consortium together with integral query languages, rule languages and distributed infrastructure for information interchange. These features are highly desirable for the {OBO} content as well. A convenient method for leveraging these features for {OBO} ontologies is by transforming {OBO} ontologies to {OWL}. {RESULTS}: We have developed a methodology for translating {OBO} ontologies to {OWL} using the organization of the Semantic Web itself to guide the work. The approach reveals that the constructs of {OBO} can be grouped together to form a similar layer cake. Thus we were able to decompose the problem into two parts. Most {OBO} constructs have easy and obvious equivalence to a construct in {OWL}. A small subset of {OBO} constructs requires deeper consideration. We have defined transformations for all constructs in an effort to foster a standard common mapping between {OBO} and {OWL}. Our mapping produces {OWL}-{DL}, a Description Logics based subset of {OWL} with desirable computational properties for efficiency and correctness. Our Java implementation of the mapping is part of the official Gene Ontology project source. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our transformation system provides a lossless roundtrip mapping for {OBO} ontologies, i.e. an {OBO} ontology may be translated to {OWL} and back without loss of knowledge. In addition, it provides a roadmap for bridging the gap between the two ontology languages in order to enable the use of ontology content in a language independent manner.}

This paper is a synthetic overview of current platforms that can be used for data management purposes. Adopting a pragmatic view on data management, the paper focuses on solutions that can be adopted in the long tail of science, where investments in tools and manpower are modest. First, a broad set of data management platforms is presented\textemdashsome designed for institutional repositories and digital libraries\textemdashto select a short list of the more promising ones for data management. These platforms are compared considering their architecture, support for metadata, existing programming interfaces, as well as their search mechanisms and community acceptance. In this process, the stakeholders\textquoteright requirements are also taken into account. The results show that there is still plenty of room for improvement, mainly regarding the specificity of data description in different domains, as well as the potential for integration of the data management platforms with existing research management tools. Nevertheless, depending on the context, some platforms can meet all or part of the stakeholders\textquoteright requirements.}

Researchers desire to shorten the workflows from data generation to analysis and publication, and the full workflow needs to become transparent to multiple stakeholders, including research administrators and funders. This poses challenges for research infrastructures and user-oriented data services in terms of not only making data and workflows findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, but also doing so in a way that leverages machine support for better efficiency. One primary need to be addressed is that of findability, and achieving better findability has benefits for other aspects of data and workflow management. In this article, we describe how machine capabilities can be extended to make workflows more findable, in particular by leveraging the Digital Object Architecture, common object operations and machine learning techniques.}

abstract = {Seventeen years after its initial publication at {ICSE} 2000, the Representational State Transfer ({REST}) architectural style continues to hold significance as both a guide for understanding how the World Wide Web is designed to work and an example of how principled design, through the application of architectural styles, can impact the development and understanding of large-scale software architecture. However, {REST} has also become an industry buzzword: frequently abused to suit a particular argument, confused with the general notion of using {HTTP}, and denigrated for not being more like a programming methodology or implementation framework. In this paper, we chart the history, evolution, and shortcomings of {REST}, as well as several related architectural styles that it inspired, from the perspective of a chain of doctoral dissertations produced by the University of California's Institute for Software Research at {UC} Irvine. These successive theses share a common theme: extending the insights of {REST} to new domains and, in their own way, exploring the boundary of software engineering as it applies to decentralized software architectures and architectural design. We conclude with discussion of the circumstances, environment, and organizational characteristics that gave rise to this body of work.},

Achieving interoperability within {EOSC} is essential in order for the federation of services that will compose {EOSC} to provide added value for service users. In the context of the {FAIR} principles, interoperability is discussed in relation to the fact that \textquotedblleftresearch data usually need to be integrated with other data; in addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing\textquotedblright. Our view on interoperability does not only consider data but also the many other research artefacts that may be used in the context of research activity, such as software code, scientific workflows, laboratory protocols, open hardware designs, etc. It also considers the need to make services and e-infrastructures as interoperable as possible. This document identifies the general principles that should drive the creation of the {EOSC} Interoperability Framework ({EOSC} {IF}), and organises them into the four layers that are commonly considered in other interoperability frameworks (e.g., the European Interoperability Framework - {EIF}): technical, semantic, organisational and legal interoperability. For each of these layers, a catalogue of problems and needs, as well as challenges and high-level recommendations have been proposed, which should be considered in the further development and implementation of the {EOSC} {IF} components. Such requirements and recommendations have been developed after an extensive review of related literature as well as by running interviews with stakeholders from {ERICs} (European Research Infrastructure Consortia), {ESFRI} (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures) projects, service providers and research communities. Some examples of such requirements are: \textquotedblleftevery semantic artefact that is being maintained in {EOSC} must have sufficient associated documentation, with clear examples of usage and conceptual diagrams\textquotedblright, or {\textquotedblleftCoarse}-grained and fine-grained dataset (and other research object) search tools need to be made available\textquotedblright, etc. The document finally contains a proposal for the management of {FAIR} Digital Objects in the context of {EOSC} and a reference architecture for the {EOSC} Interoperability Framework that is inspired by and extends the European Interoperability Reference Architecture ({EIRA}), identifying the main building blocks required.}

abstract = {Data science is facing the following major challenges: (1) developing scalable cross-disciplinary capabilities, (2) dealing with the increasing data volumes and their inherent complexity, (3) building tools that help to build trust, (4) creating mechanisms to efficiently operate in the domain of scientific assertions, (5) turning data into actionable knowledge units and (6) promoting data interoperability. As a way to overcome these challenges, we further develop the proposals by early Internet pioneers for Digital Objects as encapsulations of data and metadata made accessible by persistent identifiers. In the past decade, this concept was revisited by various groups within the Research Data Alliance and put in the context of the {FAIR} Guiding Principles for findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable data. The basic components of a {FAIR} Digital Object ({FDO}) as a self-contained, typed, machine-actionable data package are explained. A survey of use cases has indicated the growing interest of research communities in {FDO} solutions. We conclude that the {FDO} concept has the potential to act as the interoperable federative core of a hyperinfrastructure initiative such as the European Open Science Cloud ({EOSC}).}

abstract = {Repeatability of study setups and reproducibility of research results by underlying data are major requirements in science. Until now, abstract models for describing the structural logic of studies in environmental sciences are lacking and tools for data management are insufficient. Mandatory for repeatability and reproducibility is the use of sophisticated data management solutions going beyond data file sharing. Particularly, it implies maintenance of coherent data along workflows. Design data concern elements from elementary domains of operations being transformation, measurement and transaction. Operation design elements and method information are specified for each consecutive workflow segment from field to laboratory campaigns. The strict linkage of operation design element values, operation values and objects is essential. For enabling coherence of corresponding objects along consecutive workflow segments, the assignment of unique identifiers and the specification of their relations are mandatory. The abstract model presented here addresses these aspects, and the software {DiversityDescriptions} ({DWB}-{DD}) facilitates the management of thusly connected digital data objects and structures. {DWB}-{DD} allows for an individual specification of operation design elements and their linking to objects. Two workflow design use cases, one for {DNA} barcoding and another for cultivation of fungal isolates, are given. To publish those structured data, standard schema mapping and {XML}-provision of digital objects are essential. Schemas useful for this mapping include the Ecological Markup Language, the Schema for Meta-omics Data of Collection Objects and the Standard for Structured Descriptive Data. Data pipelines with {DWB}-{DD} include the mapping and conversion between schemas and functions for data publishing and archiving according to the Open Archival Information System standard. The setting allows for repeatability of study setups, reproducibility of study results and for supporting work groups to structure and maintain their data from the beginning of a study. The theory of '{FAIR}++' digital objects is introduced. \copyright The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press.}

abstract = {Reusing ontologies and their terms is a principle and best practice that most ontology development methodologies strongly encourage. Reuse comes with the promise to support the semantic interoperability and to reduce engineering costs. In this paper, we present a descriptive study of the current extent of term reuse and overlap among biomedical ontologies. We use the corpus of biomedical ontologies stored in the {BioPortal} repository, and analyze different types of reuse and overlap constructs. While we find an approximate term overlap between 25-31\%, the term reuse is only \textless 9\%, with most ontologies reusing fewer than 5\% of their terms from a small set of popular ontologies. Clustering analysis shows that the terms reused by a common set of ontologies have \textgreater90\% semantic similarity, hinting that ontology developers tend to reuse terms that are sibling or parent-child nodes. We validate this finding by analysing the logs generated from a Protégé plugin that enables developers to reuse terms from {BioPortal}. We find most reuse constructs were 2-level subtrees on the higher levels of the class hierarchy. We developed a Web application that visualizes reuse dependencies and overlap among ontologies, and that proposes similar terms from {BioPortal} for a term of interest. We also identified a set of error patterns that indicate that ontology developers did intend to reuse terms from other ontologies, but that they were using different and sometimes incorrect representations. Our results stipulate the need for semi-automated tools that augment term reuse in the ontology engineering process through personalized recommendations.}

It gives an idea which software components are robust and used for many years, which components are comparatively new and are being tested out in pilot projects and what the challenges are that need to be urgently addressed by the {FDO} community. After basically only one year of advancing the {FDO} specifications by the {FDO} Forum we can recognise an increasing momentum to test and integrate essential {FDO} components. However, many developments still occur as soloistic engagements that offer a scattered picture. It is widely agreed that it is now time to combine these different pilots to comprehensive testbeds, to identify still existing gaps and to turn some services into components of a convincing and stable infrastructure. This step is urgently needed to convince even more institutions to invest in {FDO} technology and therefore to increase {FAIRness} of the evolving global data space.}

abstract = {The traditional databases are not capable of handling unstructured data and high volumes of real-time datasets. Diverse datasets are unstructured lead to big data, and it is laborious to store, manage, process, analyze, visualize, and extract the useful insights from these datasets using traditional database approaches. However, many technical aspects exist in refining large heterogeneous datasets in the trend of big data. This paper aims to present a generalized view of complete big data system which includes several stages and key components of each stage in processing the big data. In particular, we compare and contrast various distributed file systems and {MapReduce}-supported {NoSQL} databases concerning certain parameters in data management process. Further, we present distinct distributed/cloud-based machine learning ({ML}) tools that play a key role to design, develop and deploy data models. The paper investigates case studies on distributed {ML} tools such as Mahout, Spark {MLlib}, and {FlinkML}. Further, we classify analytics based on the type of data, domain, and application. We distinguish various visualization tools pertaining three parameters: functionality, analysis capabilities, and supported development environment. Furthermore, we systematically investigate big data tools and technologies (Hadoop 3.0, Spark 2.3) including distributed/cloud-based stream processing tools in a comparative approach. Moreover, we discuss functionalities of several {SQL} Query tools on Hadoop based on 10 parameters. Finally, We present some critical points relevant to research directions and opportunities according to the current trend of big data. Investigating infrastructure tools for big data with recent developments provides a better understanding that how different tools and technologies apply to solve real-life applications.}

abstract = {Typing is a well known concept to prepare services for data processing for instance by choosing the correct service to a mime type for processing. But a lot more metadata elements, like availability and access conditions, provenance, processing preconditions or integrity parameters, are useful to be known in advance for preprocessing data services. In order to expose such metadata independently from data access, it can be stored directly within the persistent identifier structure pointing to the data itsself. Such metadata is called {PID} information type. But the correctness of the type entries needs high accuracy, because all following services are relying on their expressiveness. Data Type Registries are emerging for describing such types, but currently there is no automated way to control the content of types. This work introduces an approach to automatically derive schemas from hierarchically organized type descriptions in a recursive way and highlights the advantages of the resulting precision in a couple of application examples.},

The recommendations cover a broad area of topics, including certification, infrastructure components, stewardship, costs, rewards, collaboration, training, support, and data management. These recommendations were prioritized according to their perceived urgency by different stakeholder groups and associated with actions as well as suggested action owners. This article is the output of three workshops organized by the projects {FAIRsFAIR}, {RDA} Europe, {OpenAIRE}, {EOSC}-hub, and {FREYA} designed to explore, discuss, and formulate recommendations among stakeholders in the scientific community. While the results are a work-in-progress, the challenges and priorities outlined provide a detailed and unique overview of current issues seen as crucial by the community that can sharpen and improve the roadmap toward a {FAIR} data ecosystem. \copyright 2020 The Authors.}

In order to fulfill the promises of open science, reliable and sustainable research data infrastructures must be developed. While the {FAIR} data principles provide a promising conceptual basis for developing such data infrastructures, they do not provide technological guidance on how to do so. Computer science is uniquely situated to fill this gap by researching and developing tools and technical specifications which can help to realize the creation of {FAIR} data infrastructures. To this end, this Dagstuhl Perspectives Workshop brought together computer scientists and digital infrastructure experts from across disciplinary domains to discuss key challenges and technical solutions to implementing and promoting the establishment of {FAIR}-compliant infrastructures for research data. This manifesto reports the findings from the workshop and provides recommendations along two lines: (1) how computer science can contribute to implementing {FAIR} data infrastructures and (2) how to make computer science research itself more {FAIR}.}

Requirements for detecting bad data differ across communities, fields, and tasks, but nearly all involve some form of data validation. This book introduces data validation and describes its practical use in day-to-day data exchange. The Semantic Web offers a bold, new take on how to organize, distribute, index, and share data. Using Web addresses ({URIs}) as identifiers for data elements enables the construction of distributed databases on a global scale. Like the Web, the Semantic Web is heralded as an information revolution, and also like the Web, it is encumbered by data quality issues. The quality of Semantic Web data is compromised by the lack of resources for data curation, for maintenance, and for developing globally applicable data models. At the enterprise scale, these problems have conventional solutions. Master data management provides an enterprise-wide vocabulary, while constraint l...}

abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture hasbeen designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. {TheWeb} has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series ofmodifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspectsof the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for themodern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment. Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best topartition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, howinformation is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, andhow all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work ismotivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, therebyobtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. Anarchitectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints. This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture viaarchitectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architecturaldesign of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles fornetwork-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architecturalproperties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce {theRepresentational} State Transfer ({REST}) architectural style and describe how {REST} hasbeen used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web. {REST} emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces,independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduceinteraction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe thesoftware engineering principles guiding {REST} and the interaction constraints chosen toretain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles.Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying {REST} to the design of the {HypertextTransfer} Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequentdeployment in Web client and server software},

abstract = {With the evolution and widespread adoption of contemporary informationtechnologies, data has taken an increasingly central role in almost all areas of human activity.While on one hand this protagonism of data brings significant benefits for the individuals andorganizations, on the other hand it is accompanied by a number of challenges. In the domain of Big Data, Linked Data and Semantic Web, common examples of these challenges includescale, performance, availability, security, diversity, complexity, semantics, manageability andfindability. In January 2014, a group of stakeholders involved in research data came together to debate how to further enhance infrastructures to support a data ecosystem that promotesdata interoperability and reuse. The main outcome of this meeting was the definition of the socalled {FAIR} Data guiding principles aimed at publishing data in a format that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable by both machines and human users. Since the seminal meeting, the {FAIR} Data initiative has grown with an increasing number of participantorganizations and involved projects. In this chapter we report the progress in the developmentof one of the components of the {FAIR} Data infrastructure, the {FAIR} Data Point ({FDP}). The {FDP} is software that, from one side, allows data owners to expose datasets in compliance withthe {FAIR} principles and, from another side, allows data users to discover information aboutthe available datasets and, ultimately, access the underlying data records.}

abstract = {This document defines the {SHACL} Shapes Constraint Language, a language for validating {RDF} graphs against a set of conditions. These conditions are provided as shapes and other constructs expressed in the form of an {RDF} graph. {RDF} graphs that are used in this manner are called "shapes graphs" in {SHACL} and the {RDF} graphs that are validated against a shapes graph are called "data graphs". As {SHACL} shape graphs are used to validate that data graphs satisfy a set of conditions they can also be viewed as a description of the data graphs that do satisfy these conditions. Such descriptions may be used for a variety of purposes beside validation, including user interface building, code generation and data integration.},
