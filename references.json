    "abstract": "The DOIP Version 2.0 as released by the DONA Foundation is endorsed as an important contribution to the FDO Forum specification stack. The DOIP interfacing protocol specifies how clients can interact with DOs independent of the technology used by a DOIP server and independent of the data organization chosen. Since FD0s are a subset of DOs, restricted by the requirement to be FAIR compliant and thus machine actionable, DOIP will also work for FDOs as specified by the FDO Forum. DOIP is an important component for implementation of FDOs using the DO approach. It has been tested by several institutions, as the Demonstrator paper from the eING WG has shown, there is a tested Software Development Kit, and there is an open-source reference implementation.",

Documents that will include specifications for FDOs which are of relevance for all persons engaged in FDO usage and which therefore will have binding functions. These documents which we call  Recommendations”will need to undergo a phased process of review and endorsement. 2. Documents from external bodies which will play an important role in specifying and using FDOs. These need to be compliant with the FDO Recommendations and thus need to be endorsed by the FDO Forum. Obviously, a shorter process will be required. 3. Documents that will have a role in defining FDO Forum activities, but will not influence the FDO specifications directly (scoping documents, event announcements, liaison documents, etc.). In this paper we will primarily describe the process for FDO Recommendations of type 1 and the special process for documents from external bodies.",

The results can be transferred to FDOs due to the direct relationship between PIDs and FDO. This document presents aspects that have been mentioned. The main message is that granularity needs to be defined by the community of users.",

    "abstract": "Global middleware infrastructure is insufficient for robust data identification, discovery, and use. While infrastructure is emerging within sub- ecosystems such as the DOI ecosystem of services purposed for data and literature objects (i.e., DataCite, CHORUS, CrossRef), in general the layers of abstraction that have made the Internet so easy to build on, is lacking for data especially for computer (machine) automated services. The goal of the PID Kernel Information recommendation is to advance a small change to middleware infrastructure by injecting a tiny amount of carefully selected metadata into a Persistent ID (PID) record. This carefully chosen and placed information has the potential to stimulate development of an entire ecosystem of third party services that can process the billions of expected PIDs and do so with more information at hand about an object (no need for costly link following) than just a unique ID. The key challenge of the PID Kernel Information working group was to determine which from amongst thousands of relevant metadata elements are suitable to embed in the PID record. This recommendation lays out principles to guide in the identification of information suitable for inclusion in the PID record. The information contained in a PID record is represented by a PID Kernel Information profile which must be publicly and globally available. For PID Kernel Information to be effective in stimulating an ecosystem of data services, the number of different profiles of PID Kernel Information must be small and their content stable. The recommendation includes a draft profile with illustrating examples and cases for adoption in practice.",

    "abstract": "My previous experiences and some preliminary studies of the relevant technical literature allowed me to identify several reasons for which the current state of the database theory seemed unsatisfactory and required further research. These reasons included: insufficient formalism of data semantics, misinterpretation of NULL values, inconsistencies in the concept of the universal relation, certain ambiguities in domain definition, and inadequate representation of facts and constraints. The commonly accepted ’sequentiality’ principle in most of the current system design methodologies imposes strong restrictions on the processes that a target system is composed of. They must be algorithmic and must not be interrupted during execution; neither may they have any parallel subprocesses as their own components. This principle can no longer be considered acceptable. In very many existing systems multiple processors perform many concurrent actions that can interact with each other. The overconcentration on data models is another disadvantage of the majority of system design methods. Many techniques pay little (or no) attention to process definition. They assume that the model of the Real World consists only of data elements and relationships among them. However, the way the processes are related to each other (in terms of precedence relation) may have considerable impact on the data model. It has been assumed that the Real World is discretisable, i.e. it may be modelled by a structure of objects. The word object is to be interpreted in a wide sense so it can mean anything within the boundaries of this part of the Real World that is to be represented in the target system. An object may then denote a fact or a physical or abstract entity, or relationships between any of these, or relationships between relationships, or even a still more complex structure. The fundamental hypothesis was formulated stating the necessity of considering the three aspects of modelling - syntax, semantics and behaviour, and these to be considered integrally. A syntactic representation of an object within a target system is called a construct A construct which cannot be decomposed further (either syntactically or semantically) is defined to be an atom. Any construct is a result of the following production rules: construct ::= atom I function construct; function ::= atom I construct. This syntax forms a sentential notation. The sentential notation allows for extensive use of denotational semantics. The meaning of a construct may be defined as a function mapping from a set of syntactic constructs to the appropriate semantic domains; these in turn appear to be sets of functions since a construct may have a meaning in more than one class of objects. Because of its functional form the meaning of a construct may be derived from the meaning of its components. The issue of system behaviour needed further investigation and a revision of the conventional model of computing. The sequentiality principle has been rejected, concurrency being regarded as a natural property of processes. A postulate has been formulated that any potential parallelism should be constructively used for data/process design and that the process structure would affect the data model. An important distinction has been made between a process declaration - considered as a form of data or an abstraction of knowledge - and a process application that corresponds to a physical action performed by a processor, according to a specific process declaration. In principle, a process may be applied to any construct - including its own representation - and it is a matter of semantics to state whether or not it is sensible to do so. The process application mechanism has been explained in terms of formal systems theory by introducing an abstract machine with two input and two output types of channels. The system behaviour has been described by defining a process calculus. It is based on logical and functional properties of a discrete time model and provides a means to handle expressions composed of process-variables connected by logical functors. Basic terms of the calculus are: constructs and operations (equivalence, approximation, precedence, incidence, free-parallelism, strict-parallelism). Certain properties of these operations (e.g. associativity or transitivity) allow for handling large expressions. Rules for decomposing/integrating process applications, analogous in some sense to those forming the basis for structured programming, have been derived.",

In this paper we look from a technical point of view how the concept of Digital Objects (DO) with its inherent abstraction, binding and encapsulation potential could help us to build FAIR compliant data infrastructures as envisaged for example by the European Open Science Cloud. Basic components of such a DO-based approach have been specified and are being used by some scientific communities.",

    "abstract": "This document has been developed by the Interoperability Task Force of the EOSC Executive Board FAIR Working Group, with participation from the Architecture WG. Achieving interoperability within EOSC is essential in order for the federation of services that will compose EOSC to provide added value for service users. In the context of the FAIR principles, interoperability is discussed in relation to the fact that data usually need to be integrated with other data; in addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing”. Our view on interoperability does not only consider data but also the many other research artefacts that may be used in the context of research activity, such as software code, scientific workflows, laboratory protocols, open hardware designs, etc. It also considers the need to make services and e-infrastructures as interoperable as possible. This document identifies the general principles that should drive the creation of the EOSC Interoperability Framework (EOSC IF), and organises them into the four layers that are commonly considered in other interoperability frameworks (e.g., the European Interoperability Framework - EIF): technical, semantic, organisational and legal interoperability. For each of these layers, a catalogue of problems and needs, as well as challenges and high-level recommendations have been proposed, which should be considered in the further development and implementation of the EOSC IF components. Such requirements and recommendations have been developed after an extensive review of related literature as well as by running interviews with stakeholders from ERICs (European Research Infrastructure Consortia), ESFRI (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures) projects, service providers and research communities. Some examples of such requirements are: semantic artefact that is being maintained in EOSC must have sufficient associated documentation, with clear examples of usage and conceptual diagrams”, or -grained and fine-grained dataset (and other research object) search tools need to be made available”, etc. The document finally contains a proposal for the management of FAIR Digital Objects in the context of EOSC and a reference architecture for the EOSC Interoperability Framework that is inspired by and extends the European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA), identifying the main building blocks required.",

    "abstract": "This paper gives a summary of implementation activities in the realm of FAIR Digital Objects (FDO). It gives an idea which software components are robust and used for many years, which components are comparatively new and are being tested out in pilot projects and what the challenges are that need to be urgently addressed by the FDO community. After basically only one year of advancing the FDO specifications by the FDO Forum we can recognise an increasing momentum to test and integrate essential FDO components. However, many developments still occur as soloistic engagements that offer a scattered picture. It is widely agreed that it is now time to combine these different pilots to comprehensive testbeds, to identify still existing gaps and to turn some services into components of a convincing and stable infrastructure. This step is urgently needed to convince even more institutions to invest in FDO technology and therefore to increase FAIRness of the evolving global data space.",

    "abstract": "This document describes fundamental aspects of an infrastructure that is open in its architecture and which supports a large and extensible class of distributed digital information services. Digital libraries are one example of such services; numerous other examples of such services may be found in emerging electronic commerce applications. Here we define basic entities to be found in such a system, in which information in the form of digital objects is stored, accessed, disseminated and managed. We provide naming conventions for identifying and locating digital objects, describe a service for using object names to locate and disseminate objects, and provide elements of an access protocol. We use the term digital object here in a technical sense, to be defined precisely below. Files, databases and so forth that one may ordinarily think of as objects with a digital existence are not digital objects in the sense used here, at least not until they are made into an appropriate data structure, etc., as we will describe shortly. Only the most basic elements of the infrastructure are described herein. These elements are intended to constitute a minimal set of requirements and services that must be in place to effect the infrastructure of a universal, open, wide-area digital information infrastructure system (\"the System\"). We anticipate that many other services and elaborations will come into existence as the System is further developed, either building upon or otherwise added to these elements. This paper focuses on the network-based aspects of the infrastructure, namely those for which knowledge of the contents of digital objects is not required. Definition of the content-based aspects of the infrastructure is purposely not addressed in this paper. An important goal in limiting the description of the infrastructure in this way is not to constrain the higher level user and service level choices that, for many reasons, might be inappropriate to fix upon at this point in time. With only the most basic elements of the infrastructure in place, technological evolution would not be overly constrained. Further, the likelihood of achieving widespread interoperability of services at some early point in the future will be preserved. No doubt the resulting capability will have a greater potential for enhancement and evolution through the participation of many others in helping to define it.",

    "abstract": "This paper gives a summary of implementation activities in the realm of FAIR Digital Objects (FDO). It gives an idea which software components are robust and used for many years, which components are comparatively new and are being tested out in pilot projects and what the challenges are that need to be urgently addressed by the FDO community. After basically only one year of advancing the FDO specifications by the FDO Forum we can recognise an increasing momentum to test and integrate essential FDO components. However, many developments still occur as soloistic engagements that offer a scattered picture. It is widely agreed that it is now time to combine these different pilots to comprehensive testbeds, to identify still existing gaps and to turn some services into components of a convincing and stable infrastructure. This step is urgently needed to convince even more institutions to invest in FDO technology and therefore to increase FAIRness of the evolving global data space.",
