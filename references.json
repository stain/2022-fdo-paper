    "abstract": "The DOIP Version 2.0 as released by the DONA Foundation is endorsed as an important contribution to the FDO Forum specification stack. The DOIP interfacing protocol specifies how clients can interact with DOs independent of the technology used by a DOIP server and independent of the data organization chosen. Since FD0s are a subset of DOs, restricted by the requirement to be FAIR compliant and thus machine actionable, DOIP will also work for FDOs as specified by the FDO Forum. DOIP is an important component for implementation of FDOs using the DO approach. It has been tested by several institutions, as the Demonstrator paper from the eING WG has shown, there is a tested Software Development Kit, and there is an open-source reference implementation.",

It also indicates the type of services that can be thought of at different FDO levels (PID, PID record information, metadata and content based). Finally, it describes the scope of checks that can be carried out at different levels (PID, metadata, bit-sequence). A special problem is indicated that is related to the fact that the community-based metadata can include references that are relevant for FDO level checks. A suggestion is made on how to bridge between semantic spaces.",

This requires understanding the various aspects of FDOs, of which aspects of granularity and versioning are highly important.

The results can be transferred to FDOs due to the direct relationship between PIDs and FDO. This document presents aspects that have been mentioned. The main message is that granularity needs to be defined by the community of users.",

    "abstract": "The FDO Forum differentiates between different types of documents such as: 1. Documents that will include specifications for FDOs which are of relevance for all persons engaged in FDO usage and which therefore will have binding functions. These documents which we call  Recommendations”will need to undergo a phased process of review and endorsement. 2. Documents from external bodies which will play an important role in specifying and using FDOs. These need to be compliant with the FDO Recommendations and thus need to be endorsed by the FDO Forum. Obviously, a shorter process will be required. 3. Documents that will have a role in defining FDO Forum activities, but will not influence the FDO specifications directly (scoping documents, event announcements, liaison documents, etc.). In this paper we will primarily describe the process for FDO Recommendations of type 1 and the special process for documents from external bodies.",

    "abstract": "With the evolution and widespread adoption of contemporary informationtechnologies, data has taken an increasingly central role in almost all areas of human activity.While on one hand this protagonism of data brings significant benefits for the individuals andorganizations, on the other hand it is accompanied by a number of challenges. In the domain of Big Data, Linked Data and Semantic Web, common examples of these challenges includescale, performance, availability, security, diversity, complexity, semantics, manageability andfindability. In January 2014, a group of stakeholders involved in research data came together to debate how to further enhance infrastructures to support a data ecosystem that promotesdata interoperability and reuse. The main outcome of this meeting was the definition of the socalled FAIR Data guiding principles aimed at publishing data in a format that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable by both machines and human users. Since the seminal meeting, the FAIR Data initiative has grown with an increasing number of participantorganizations and involved projects. In this chapter we report the progress in the developmentof one of the components of the FAIR Data infrastructure, the FAIR Data Point (FDP). The FDP is software that, from one side, allows data owners to expose datasets in compliance withthe FAIR principles and, from another side, allows data users to discover information aboutthe available datasets and, ultimately, access the underlying data records.",

    "abstract": "Data integration is a perennial issue in bioinformatics, with many systems being developed and many technologies offered as a panacea for its resolution. The fact that it is still a problem indicates a persistence of underlying issues. Progress has been made, but we should ask \"what lessons have been learnt?\", and \"what still needs to be done?\" Semantic Web and Web 2.0 technologies are the latest to find traction within bioinformatics data integration. Now we can ask whether the Semantic Web, mashups, or their combination, have the potential to help. This paper is based on the opening invited talk by Carole Goble given at the Health Care and Life Sciences Data Integration for the Semantic Web Workshop collocated with WWW2007. The paper expands on that talk. We attempt to place some perspective on past efforts, highlight the reasons for success and failure, and indicate some pointers to the future.",

    "abstract": "Seventeen years after its initial publication at ICSE 2000, the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style continues to hold significance as both a guide for understanding how the World Wide Web is designed to work and an example of how principled design, through the application of architectural styles, can impact the development and understanding of large-scale software architecture. However, REST has also become an industry buzzword: frequently abused to suit a particular argument, confused with the general notion of using HTTP, and denigrated for not being more like a programming methodology or implementation framework. In this paper, we chart the history, evolution, and shortcomings of REST, as well as several related architectural styles that it inspired, from the perspective of a chain of doctoral dissertations produced by the University of California’s Institute for Software Research at UC Irvine. These successive theses share a common theme: extending the insights of REST to new domains and, in their own way, exploring the boundary of software engineering as it applies to decentralized software architectures and architectural design. We conclude with discussion of the circumstances, environment, and organizational characteristics that gave rise to this body of work.",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>A key limiting factor in organising and using information from physical specimens curated in natural science collections is making that information computable, with institutional digitization tending to focus more on imaging the specimens themselves than on efficiently capturing computable data about them. Label data are traditionally manually transcribed today with high cost and low throughput, rendering such a task constrained for many collection-holding institutions at current funding levels. We show how computer vision, optical character recognition, handwriting recognition, named entity recognition and language translation technologies can be implemented into canonical workflow component libraries with findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) characteristics. These libraries are being developed in a cloud-based workflow platform—the ‘Specimen Data Refinery’ (SDR)—founded on Galaxy workflow engine, Common Workflow Language, Research Object Crates (RO-Crate) and WorkflowHub technologies. The SDR can be applied to specimens’ labels and other artefacts, offering the prospect of greatly accelerated and more accurate data capture in computable form. Two kinds of FAIR Digital Objects (FDO) are created by packaging outputs of SDR workflows and workflow components as digital objects with metadata, a persistent identifier, and a specific type definition. The first kind of FDO are computable Digital Specimen (DS) objects that can be consumed/produced by workflows, and other applications. A single DS is the input data structure submitted to a workflow that is modified by each workflow component in turn to produce a refined DS at the end. The Specimen Data Refinery provides a library of such components that can be used individually, or in series. To cofunction, each library component describes the fields it requires from the DS and the fields it will in turn populate or enrich. The second kind of FDO, RO-Crates gather and archive the diverse set of digital and real-world resources, configurations, and actions (the provenance) contributing to a unit of research work, allowing that work to be faithfully recorded and reproduced. Here we describe the Specimen Data Refinery with its motivating requirements, focusing on what is essential in the creation of canonical workflow component libraries and its conformance with the requirements of an emerging FDO Core Specification being developed by the FDO Forum.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<ns3:p>Scientific data analyses often combine several computational tools in automated pipelines, or workflows. Thousands of such workflows have been used in the life sciences, though their composition has remained a cumbersome manual process due to a lack of standards for annotation, assembly, and implementation. Recent technological advances have returned the long-standing vision of automated workflow composition into focus.</ns3:p><ns3:p> This article summarizes a recent Lorentz Center workshop dedicated to automated composition of workflows in the life sciences. We survey previous initiatives to automate the composition process, and discuss the current state of the art and future perspectives. We start by drawing the “big picture” of the scientific workflow development life cycle, before surveying and discussing current methods, technologies and practices for semantic domain modelling, automation in workflow development, and workflow assessment. Finally, we derive a roadmap of individual and community-based actions to work toward the vision of automated workflow development in the forthcoming years.</ns3:p><ns3:p> A central outcome of the workshop is a general description of the workflow life cycle in six stages: 1) scientific question or hypothesis, 2) conceptual workflow, 3) abstract workflow, 4) concrete workflow, 5) production workflow, and 6) scientific results. The transitions between stages are facilitated by diverse tools and methods, usually incorporating domain knowledge in some form. Formal semantic domain modelling is hard and often a bottleneck for the application of semantic technologies. However, life science communities have made considerable progress here in recent years and are continuously improving, renewing interest in the application of semantic technologies for workflow exploration, composition and instantiation. Combined with systematic benchmarking with reference data and large-scale deployment of production-stage workflows, such technologies enable a more systematic process of workflow development than we know today. We believe that this can lead to more robust, reusable, and sustainable workflows in the future.</ns3:p>",

    "abstract": "Global middleware infrastructure is insufficient for robust data identification, discovery, and use. While infrastructure is emerging within sub- ecosystems such as the DOI ecosystem of services purposed for data and literature objects (i.e., DataCite, CHORUS, CrossRef), in general the layers of abstraction that have made the Internet so easy to build on, is lacking for data especially for computer (machine) automated services. The goal of the PID Kernel Information recommendation is to advance a small change to middleware infrastructure by injecting a tiny amount of carefully selected metadata into a Persistent ID (PID) record. This carefully chosen and placed information has the potential to stimulate development of an entire ecosystem of third party services that can process the billions of expected PIDs and do so with more information at hand about an object (no need for costly link following) than just a unique ID. The key challenge of the PID Kernel Information working group was to determine which from amongst thousands of relevant metadata elements are suitable to embed in the PID record. This recommendation lays out principles to guide in the identification of information suitable for inclusion in the PID record. The information contained in a PID record is represented by a PID Kernel Information profile which must be publicly and globally available. For PID Kernel Information to be effective in stimulating an ecosystem of data services, the number of different profiles of PID Kernel Information must be small and their content stable. The recommendation includes a draft profile with illustrating examples and cases for adoption in practice.",

    "abstract": "Software reuse can lower costs and increase the quality of software development. Despite a large body of research focused on technical and organisational factors, there is still limited research on the software developers’ perspective regarding software component reuse. Therefore, this paper investigates the developers’ adoption intention to use existing software components. Information systems adoption research has extensively focused on the technological aspects and less on the individual factors. However, studying these individual differences is important, as research has shown that individuals do not always behave according to rational assumptions. This study analyses the adoption of software components based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and extends the research model by integrating the not-invented-here bias and the concept of mindfulness to account for individual differences. An empirical study with 142 software developers was conducted to empirically validate the research model. The results show that performance expectancy, social influence and not-invented here bias play an important role in the developers’ decision to adopt software components. Furthermore, findings show that a mindfulness state has a negative influence on the not-invented-here bias and it directly affects the intention to adopt existing software components.",

    "abstract": "My previous experiences and some preliminary studies of the relevant technical literature allowed me to identify several reasons for which the current state of the database theory seemed unsatisfactory and required further research. These reasons included: insufficient formalism of data semantics, misinterpretation of NULL values, inconsistencies in the concept of the universal relation, certain ambiguities in domain definition, and inadequate representation of facts and constraints. The commonly accepted ’sequentiality’ principle in most of the current system design methodologies imposes strong restrictions on the processes that a target system is composed of. They must be algorithmic and must not be interrupted during execution; neither may they have any parallel subprocesses as their own components. This principle can no longer be considered acceptable. In very many existing systems multiple processors perform many concurrent actions that can interact with each other. The overconcentration on data models is another disadvantage of the majority of system design methods. Many techniques pay little (or no) attention to process definition. They assume that the model of the Real World consists only of data elements and relationships among them. However, the way the processes are related to each other (in terms of precedence relation) may have considerable impact on the data model. It has been assumed that the Real World is discretisable, i.e. it may be modelled by a structure of objects. The word object is to be interpreted in a wide sense so it can mean anything within the boundaries of this part of the Real World that is to be represented in the target system. An object may then denote a fact or a physical or abstract entity, or relationships between any of these, or relationships between relationships, or even a still more complex structure. The fundamental hypothesis was formulated stating the necessity of considering the three aspects of modelling - syntax, semantics and behaviour, and these to be considered integrally. A syntactic representation of an object within a target system is called a construct A construct which cannot be decomposed further (either syntactically or semantically) is defined to be an atom. Any construct is a result of the following production rules: construct ::= atom I function construct; function ::= atom I construct. This syntax forms a sentential notation. The sentential notation allows for extensive use of denotational semantics. The meaning of a construct may be defined as a function mapping from a set of syntactic constructs to the appropriate semantic domains; these in turn appear to be sets of functions since a construct may have a meaning in more than one class of objects. Because of its functional form the meaning of a construct may be derived from the meaning of its components. The issue of system behaviour needed further investigation and a revision of the conventional model of computing. The sequentiality principle has been rejected, concurrency being regarded as a natural property of processes. A postulate has been formulated that any potential parallelism should be constructively used for data/process design and that the process structure would affect the data model. An important distinction has been made between a process declaration - considered as a form of data or an abstraction of knowledge - and a process application that corresponds to a physical action performed by a processor, according to a specific process declaration. In principle, a process may be applied to any construct - including its own representation - and it is a matter of semantics to state whether or not it is sensible to do so. The process application mechanism has been explained in terms of formal systems theory by introducing an abstract machine with two input and two output types of channels. The system behaviour has been described by defining a process calculus. It is based on logical and functional properties of a discrete time model and provides a means to handle expressions composed of process-variables connected by logical functors. Basic terms of the calculus are: constructs and operations (equivalence, approximation, precedence, incidence, free-parallelism, strict-parallelism). Certain properties of these operations (e.g. associativity or transitivity) allow for handling large expressions. Rules for decomposing/integrating process applications, analogous in some sense to those forming the basis for structured programming, have been derived.",

    "abstract": "This document has been developed by the Interoperability Task Force of the EOSC Executive Board FAIR Working Group, with participation from the Architecture WG. Achieving interoperability within EOSC is essential in order for the federation of services that will compose EOSC to provide added value for service users. In the context of the FAIR principles, interoperability is discussed in relation to the fact that data usually need to be integrated with other data; in addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing”. Our view on interoperability does not only consider data but also the many other research artefacts that may be used in the context of research activity, such as software code, scientific workflows, laboratory protocols, open hardware designs, etc. It also considers the need to make services and e-infrastructures as interoperable as possible. This document identifies the general principles that should drive the creation of the EOSC Interoperability Framework (EOSC IF), and organises them into the four layers that are commonly considered in other interoperability frameworks (e.g., the European Interoperability Framework - EIF): technical, semantic, organisational and legal interoperability. For each of these layers, a catalogue of problems and needs, as well as challenges and high-level recommendations have been proposed, which should be considered in the further development and implementation of the EOSC IF components. Such requirements and recommendations have been developed after an extensive review of related literature as well as by running interviews with stakeholders from ERICs (European Research Infrastructure Consortia), ESFRI (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures) projects, service providers and research communities. Some examples of such requirements are: semantic artefact that is being maintained in EOSC must have sufficient associated documentation, with clear examples of usage and conceptual diagrams”, or -grained and fine-grained dataset (and other research object) search tools need to be made available”, etc. The document finally contains a proposal for the management of FAIR Digital Objects in the context of EOSC and a reference architecture for the EOSC Interoperability Framework that is inspired by and extends the European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA), identifying the main building blocks required.",

However, current practices are often motivated by subjective, case-by-case decisions, which hamper the definition of a recommended behaviour. In this chapter we argue that to date there are no effective solutions for supporting developers’decision-making process when deciding on an ontology reuse strategy. The objective is twofold: (i) to survey current approaches to ontology reuse, presenting motivations, strategies, benefits and limits, and (ii) to analyse two representative approaches and discuss their merits.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>FAIR Digital Objects (FDOs) are typed by a well described set of attributes, where attributes are key value pairs with a key, which refers to a syntactic description of the value. Often the description of the set of attributes is called also profile. The exact description of the attribute keys is obviously crucial for machine actionability on one hand. On the other hand an exact description of attributes can be a way to allow also human readability of the used keys. Furthermore it can often integrate legacy attribute sets that are provided inside repositories for the description of their digital objects.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>In the following we show two examples of FDO types with their attributes from different viewpoints. The two examples are: the Persistent Identifiers (PID) for Instruments example and the DARIAH (see https://de.dariah.eu) use case. In both cases the Handle system is used for the persistent identifiers, the FDO record is provided by the Handle record of the PID and the attributes can be found here as type-data pairs in the phrasing of the Handle system.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>1 Example 1: PID for Instruments</jats:bold>\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The PID for instrument example goes back to the development of kernel metadata, which is seen as minimally required to reference and describe scientific instruments Stocker et al. 2020. The value space for the attributes here often contains hierarchical objects and can also be lists of attributes.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>An example of such an attribute definition is that of a single manufacturer of an instrument that occurs in a list of manufacturers here: http://dtr-test.pidconsortium.eu/#objects/21.T11148/7adfcd13b3b01de0d875.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>1.1. The Handle Record for a Full PID for Instruments</jats:bold>\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>In this case one uses the references to the attribute definitions as keys for the values, which are often lists or objects. The Handle Record for a full attribute list of a PID for Instruments can be obtained from the Handle Proxy with https://hdl.handle.net/21.T11998/0000-001A-3905-1?noredirect</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The structure of this FDO record is defined as a type definition at the ePIC Date Type Registry Schwardmann 2020 with http://dtr-test.pidconsortium.eu/objects/21.T11148/17ce618137e697852ea6 . This way we can also refer to this structure definition in a qualified key value pair like TYPE/0.TYPE and then use as keys in the FDO record the names as they are given for keys in this structure. This way an FDO record becomes a human readable form without loosing any machine readability. For further details see: https://hdl.handle.net/21.T11998/0000-001A-3905-8?noredirect</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>In both cases the full instrument descriptions are completely stored in the Handle database of the Handle PID service. The PID itself is a metadata object and can be seen as an FDO of its own.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>1.2. Type for a PID4Inst based on Attributes</jats:bold>\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The type for such FDOs is given via proxy https://hdl.handle.net/21.T11148/17ce618137e697852ea6 in the ePIC DTR</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>1.3. PID4Inst in a Repository</jats:bold>\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Another option is to store the metadata objects of instrument descriptions in repositories. In this case a schema is needed to describe the metadata elements that are needed for the description. The existing attribute definitions could be bundled here into a single complex definition, which is syntactically almost identical to the type definition for instruments.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>From such a complex definition one could derive a schema for the repository entries. In this case the schema was directly derived from the type, which is conceptually different from attribute definitions, but syntactically similar and therefore exploitable by the same services. The result of the schema derivation can then be directly fed into the ingest module of repositories, in the following figure for example into the CORDRA schema module for the definition of attribute types: https://hdl.handle.net/21.T11148/c2c8c452912d57a44117</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>An example of such a PID for instrument object in a repository is given at https://vm11.pid.gwdg.de:8445/objects/21.11145/8fefa88dea40956037ec</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>2. Example 2: The DARIAH Use Case </jats:bold>\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>This example evolved in the humanities in the DARIAH project about five years ago with the DARIAH repository (Kálmán et al. 2016, DARIAH-DE 2016). The Handle record structure was created far before FDO records have been discussed. It uses key value pairs with human readable keys as the type and provides relatively atomic values. For humans the key here is a description for the value space that can be expected: https://hdl.handle.net/21.11113/0000-000B-CA4C-D?noredirect</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The use of human readable keys does however not match the goal of machine readability of this description. Additionally it has the risk of uncertainty and ambiguity.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>2.1. Attribute Definitions</jats:bold>\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>In order to make these attributes machine readable, attribute definitions for the allowed value spaces were needed and can be found in the ePIC data type registries. The following basic information type for an email address can be used as the reference key for the value space given for the 'RESPONSIBLE' type above for instance: https://dtr-test.pidconsortium.eu/#objects/21.T11148/e117a4a29bfd07438c1e</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Attribute definitions for all attributes used in the DARIAH example are given in the ePIC data type registrie. This way one is able to define a type for the DARIAH Handle records.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>2.2. An FDO Type of Legacy Repository Records</jats:bold>\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Such a type definition is given at: https://dtr-test.pidconsortium.eu/#objects/21.T11148/f1eea855587d8b1f66da</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>If this type is the known type of all objects in the DARIAH repository, the references to the keys are named very similar the human readable form of the Handle record.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Usually and as we have seen in the previous PID4Inst example the type of the FDO would be another attribute of the FDO. This would require an adaption of the attributes of all digital objects of the DARIAH repository. But since all digital objects of the DARIAH repository follow the same profile and all its digital objects have the same PID prefix, it would be sufficient to implement this additional attribute at the prefix level. Together with a rule that attributes on a lower level dominate attributes on a higher level, this additional prefix attribute makes FDOs out of legacy digital objects that have been defined a long time ago.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>3. Presentation</jats:bold>\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>In the presentation we will describe based on the two examples above how machine and human readability can be supported at the same time by FDO types and discuss the implementation of hierarchical type definitions as the basic infrastructure for FAIRness of data in more detail.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The FAIR principles for scientific data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) are also relevant to other digital objects such as research software and scientific workflows that operate on scientific data. The FAIR principles can be applied to the data being handled by a scientific workflow as well as the processes, software, and other infrastructure which are necessary to specify and execute a workflow. The FAIR principles were designed as guidelines, rather than rules, that would allow for differences in standards for different communities and for different degrees of compliance. There are many practical considerations which impact the level of FAIR-ness that can actually be achieved, including policies, traditions, and technologies. Because of these considerations, obstacles are often encountered during the workflow lifecycle that trace directly to shortcomings in the implementation of the FAIR principles. Here, we detail some cases, without naming names, in which data and workflows were Findable but otherwise lacking in areas commonly needed and expected by modern FAIR methods, tools, and users. We describe how some of these problems, all of which were overcome successfully, have motivated us to push on systems and approaches for fully FAIR workflows.",

    "abstract": "This paper gives a summary of implementation activities in the realm of FAIR Digital Objects (FDO). It gives an idea which software components are robust and used for many years, which components are comparatively new and are being tested out in pilot projects and what the challenges are that need to be urgently addressed by the FDO community. After basically only one year of advancing the FDO specifications by the FDO Forum we can recognise an increasing momentum to test and integrate essential FDO components. However, many developments still occur as soloistic engagements that offer a scattered picture. It is widely agreed that it is now time to combine these different pilots to comprehensive testbeds, to identify still existing gaps and to turn some services into components of a convincing and stable infrastructure. This step is urgently needed to convince even more institutions to invest in FDO technology and therefore to increase FAIRness of the evolving global data space.",

From a conceptual point of view, cultural and scientific heritage should widen for broad human and computer access. Web semantics support the transformation of information to knowledge on a large and open scale and cultural and scientific heritage should benefit from that, especially if we see the latter as a pillar in a lean system, such as E-Democracy that seeks for permanent improvement. Cultural and scientific heritage has a primary role in education of individuals but also in the optimization process of knowledge society through the humane collective approach of trial and error. In order to build a society of inclusion using vertical (temporal) and horizontal (spatial) inquiries in social values, religions, beliefs and rituals we must facilitate broaden and less restrictive access. One way to achieve this task is by using linked data for connectivity and meaning of information and the standard of JSON-LD for extensive and simple digital access.",

    "abstract": "The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture hasbeen designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. TheWeb has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series ofmodifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspectsof the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for themodern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment. Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best topartition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, howinformation is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, andhow all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work ismotivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, therebyobtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. Anarchitectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints. This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture viaarchitectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architecturaldesign of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles fornetwork-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architecturalproperties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce theRepresentational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST hasbeen used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web. REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces,independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduceinteraction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe thesoftware engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen toretain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles.Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying REST to the design of the HypertextTransfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequentdeployment in Web client and server software",

    "abstract": "This document describes fundamental aspects of an infrastructure that is open in its architecture and which supports a large and extensible class of distributed digital information services. Digital libraries are one example of such services; numerous other examples of such services may be found in emerging electronic commerce applications. Here we define basic entities to be found in such a system, in which information in the form of digital objects is stored, accessed, disseminated and managed. We provide naming conventions for identifying and locating digital objects, describe a service for using object names to locate and disseminate objects, and provide elements of an access protocol. We use the term digital object here in a technical sense, to be defined precisely below. Files, databases and so forth that one may ordinarily think of as objects with a digital existence are not digital objects in the sense used here, at least not until they are made into an appropriate data structure, etc., as we will describe shortly. Only the most basic elements of the infrastructure are described herein. These elements are intended to constitute a minimal set of requirements and services that must be in place to effect the infrastructure of a universal, open, wide-area digital information infrastructure system (\"the System\"). We anticipate that many other services and elaborations will come into existence as the System is further developed, either building upon or otherwise added to these elements. This paper focuses on the network-based aspects of the infrastructure, namely those for which knowledge of the contents of digital objects is not required. Definition of the content-based aspects of the infrastructure is purposely not addressed in this paper. An important goal in limiting the description of the infrastructure in this way is not to constrain the higher level user and service level choices that, for many reasons, might be inappropriate to fix upon at this point in time. With only the most basic elements of the infrastructure in place, technological evolution would not be overly constrained. Further, the likelihood of achieving widespread interoperability of services at some early point in the future will be preserved. No doubt the resulting capability will have a greater potential for enhancement and evolution through the participation of many others in helping to define it.",

    "abstract": "This specification describes the useof HTTP for accessing, updating, creating and deleting resources fromservers that expose their resources as Linked Data. It provides clarificationsand extensions of the rules of Linked Data [LINKED-DATA]:Use URIs as names for thingsUse HTTP URIs so that people can look up those namesWhen someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards(RDF*, SPARQL)Include links to other URIs, so that they can discover more thingsThis specification discusses standard HTTP and RDF techniques used when constructing clients and servers that create, read, and write Linked Data Platform Resources.LDP Primer provides an entry-level introduction with many examples in the context of a fictional application.LDP Best Practices and Guidelines discusses best practices that you should use, and anti-patterns you should avoid, when constructing these clients and servers. This specification defines a special type of Linked Data Platform Resource: a Container. Containers are very useful in building application models involving collections of resources, often homogeneous ones. For example, universities offer a collection of classes and a collection of faculty members, each faculty member teaches a collection of courses, and so on. This specification discusses how to work with containers. Resources can be added to containers using standard HTTP operations like POST (see section 5.2.3 HTTP POST).The intention of this specification is to enable additional rules and layered groupings of rules as additional specifications. The scope is intentionally narrow to provide a set of key rules for reading and writing Linked Data that most, if not all, other specifications will depend upon and implementations will support.This specification provides some approaches to deal with large resources. An extension to this specificationprovides the ability to break large resource representations into multiple paged responses [LDP-PAGING].For context and background, it could be useful to read Linked Data Platform Use Case and Requirements [LDP-UCR] and section 6.

The label \"ark:\" marks the start of a core ARK\nidentifier that can be made actionable by prepending the beginning of\na URL.  Meant to be usable after today's networking technologies\nbecome obsolete, that core should be recognizable in the future as a\nglobally unique ARK independent of the URL hostname, HTTP, etc.  A\nfounding principle of ARKs is that persistence is purely a matter of\nservice and neither inherent in an object nor conferred on it by a\nparticular naming syntax.  The best any identifier can do is lead\nusers to services that support robust reference.  A full-functioning\nARK leads the user to the identified object and, with the \"?info\"\ninflection appended, returns a metadata record and a commitment\nstatement that is both human- and machine-readable.  Tools exist for\nminting, binding, and resolving ARKs. \n       Responsibility for this Document \n       The ARK Alliance Technical Working Group   is responsible\nfor the content of this Internet Draft.
